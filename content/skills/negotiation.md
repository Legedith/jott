##  Practical Keys to Successful Negotiation

This section explores practical strategies for achieving positive negotiation outcomes, drawing upon real-world experiences and emphasizing the importance of relationship building and strategic thinking.

**Summary:** This section discusses the importance of choosing the right negotiation partner, building trust, understanding BATNA, knowing the difference between battles and wars, sharing information, being aware of manipulative tactics, and understanding the other party's values.

###  Negotiating with the Right Party

- **Key Point:** Ensure you're negotiating with the individual who has the authority to make decisions.
   <span style="color:blue">  "You would be amazed at how many negotiations go on with the wrong party, with the unempowered lieutenant, with somebody who really is not the decision maker, whatever." </span>
- **Example:** A negotiation for financing in Spain where the speaker and his team were negotiating with a representative who had no authority to make a deal. This resulted in a wasted negotiation. 
- **Lesson:** **Thoroughly vet your negotiation partner to ensure they have the necessary authority and power to make a deal.**

###  Building Trust

- **Key Point:** Trust is crucial in negotiations. It is based on a combination of **character, competence, and power.** 
   <span style="color:blue"> "For somebody to be trusted, they have to be high character. They have to be competent. And they have to be empowered to make a decision." </span>
- **Note:**  Trust needs to be reciprocated for successful negotiations.
- **Example:** The speaker's experience with negotiating joint ventures with a life insurance company where the executive made it clear that the negotiation was not about reaching a mutually agreeable deal.
  <span style="color:blue"> "Joel, sit down. Just take notes. Your job here is just to take notes. We're not negotiating anything. Just take notes. We're the life company. We've got all the money. You're just the developer. Take notes." </span>
- **Lesson:** **Building trust with your negotiation partner is essential. Assess their character, competence, and power, and strive to be equally trustworthy yourself.**


### Understanding BATNA

- **Key Point:** BATNA stands for **Best Alternative To a Negotiated Agreement**. It's your best option if the current negotiation fails. 
  <span style="color:blue"> "That's Best Alternative To a Negotiated Agreement. OK, this is a term that was developed by Fisher and Yuri in 1981 out of the Harvard Negotiation study, which they really found that if people could go into a negotiation with an idea of what is their best alternative to this negotiation working out successfully, they came out with better end results." </span>
- **Note:** Knowing your BATNA gives you confidence and leverage in negotiations.
- **Example:** The speaker's early career ambition to be known as a negotiator who wouldn't budge on price. This led to a situation where the speaker, needing to secure a deal, had to find another investor to make it happen.
- **Lesson:** **Develop a clear understanding of your BATNA. It's your fallback position and allows you to make informed decisions during negotiations.**

### Identifying Elephants and Ants

- **Key Point:** Recognize the difference between important negotiation points (elephants) and less critical ones (ants).
    <span style="color:blue">  "Have you ever negotiated with somebody for whom every deal point is something that they have to win? Everything is competitive. Everything that's brought up, they have to win every deal point. I'm here to submit to you that that's a really dumb way to negotiate." </span>
- **Note:** Be willing to concede on some minor points to secure larger, more important outcomes.
- **Example:** The speaker's experience teaching a negotiation course at Stanford where students were instructed to "win" the negotiation. This led to a competitive environment, making deals more difficult and relationships strained.
  <span style="color:blue">  "People were frustrated. People were frustrated and they hated their classmates. They said, “I will never do business with these turkeys again. I had no idea these people were such jerks."  </span>
- **Lesson:** **Prioritize your negotiation goals. Identify the key issues (elephants) and be prepared to compromise on less important points (ants) to achieve a successful outcome.**

### Sharing Information

- **Key Point:** Sharing information can create a more collaborative negotiation environment.
    <span style="color:blue">  "So there's a lot more sharing of information in that kind of a model of negotiation. It doesn't always. It's not always something you can do."  </span>
- **Example:** The speaker's experience with negotiating deals with a limited partner who liked to negotiate price.
  <span style="color:blue">  "He said, “Joel, I just got to tell you, I like to negotiate price. I don't feel good unless I can negotiate price. So if you want it to be a million dollars, tell me it's a million 50. Just tell me it's a million 50. I'll come back with a million. And then we'll both feel good.” "  </span>
- **Lesson:** **Consider the benefits of sharing information to foster transparency and a collaborative negotiation atmosphere. This can lead to creative solutions and mutually beneficial outcomes.**

### Recognizing and Handling Manipulative Tactics

- **Key Point:** Be aware of common manipulative tactics, but don't let them derail the negotiation.
    <span style="color:blue">  "You have to be aware of them. You have to be. And it tells you something. If somebody's using, I was thinking when somebody's shouting at me or walking out of the room or throwing things, there's information in that."  </span>
- **Note:** Use questioning and information gathering to defuse situations.
- **Example:** The speaker's experience with a real estate partner who used manipulative tactics like throwing things and shouting to get his way.
  <span style="color:blue">  "In any document that's that thick, there's something in it for me."  </span>
- **Lesson:** **Be prepared for manipulative tactics. Stay calm, use questioning to gain information, and don't be afraid to call them out. This can often lead to a more productive negotiation.**

### Understanding the Other Party's Values

- **Key Point:** Gaining insight into the other party's values helps you create solutions that meet their needs.
    <span style="color:blue"> "The more you can understand their values, and I'll tell you stories in them that illustrate each of these, but the more you can understand really what it is that drives them, what's important to them, the more likely you are to craft a solution to things that satisfies what it is that's important to them."  </span>
- **Note:** This is crucial for achieving win-win outcomes.
- **Example:** The speaker's experience with a senior partner who wanted to agree on values for a property deal. However, the speaker recognized that disagreeing on values allowed him to select deals where he felt he was getting a better outcome.
- **Lesson:** **Go beyond just understanding the other party's objectives. Seek to understand their underlying values and motivations to create solutions that are mutually beneficial.**

### Win-Lose vs. Win-Win Negotiations

- **Key Point:**  Negotiations can be either win-lose (competitive) or win-win (collaborative).
  <span style="color:blue">  "Those of you who dread negotiations probably have experienced some of this win-lose experience, those of you who said you really enjoyed them have probably experienced more of the left-hand column."  </span>
- **Note:** The win-win approach leads to more successful and sustainable relationships. 
- **Example:** The speaker's experience teaching a negotiation course where changing the mindset from "win" to "have fun" resulted in more successful outcomes and improved relationships. 
  <span style="color:blue">  "People came out of it saying, “Man, this was a fun exercise. We like each other. Aren't Stanford MBAs cool? I just really love my classmates."  </span>
- **Lesson:** **Strive for win-win outcomes in negotiations. By focusing on collaboration and mutual benefit, you can create stronger relationships and more sustainable agreements.**



## <span style="color:green">Negotiation Mindsets and Building a Brand</span>

**Summary:** This section delves into the importance of establishing a brand as a negotiator, highlighting that every negotiation, no matter how small, builds your reputation. It emphasizes that negotiations are not just one-off events but part of a broader, ongoing series of interactions. The speaker also provides practical examples and insights into developing the right mindset for successful negotiations, particularly emphasizing the value of trust and communication.

### <span style="color:blue">The Brand of a Negotiator</span>

- Every negotiation contributes to your brand.
- **[Image_query]** A visual representation of different brands of negotiators.  
- **Think beyond episodic:** Each negotiation is part of a larger, ongoing series.
> "There are no episodic negotiations. You may think it's an episode. You may think you're going in and having a one-off deal with somebody." 

- **Develop a brand:** Consciously consider the kind of reputation you want to build as a negotiator.
>  "Think carefully about the brand you want to have."
- **Example:**  The speaker's brand evolved from "never sues" to "very reasonable but firm when crossed," making him a formidable yet fair negotiator.
> "So that's a better brand than the brand I had before, which was the guy will never sue."

### <span style="color:blue">Negotiating with Your Children: A Case Study</span>

- The speaker shares a negotiation with his daughter about getting a rat.
- **Initial volley:**  The daughter presents a strong case, using emotional appeals and framing the decision as a simple matter of responsibility. 
> "Do you hear that I'm getting a rat? Won't that be cool?"
- **Speaker's response:**  He uses humor and appeals to shared values, highlighting the downsides of rats and emphasizing his desire to spend time with her.
> "Are you nuts? I've been killing rats at the house in Woodside." 
- **Outcome:** The daughter gets the rats, demonstrating the power of balance and a willingness to win the "war" (raising a responsible child) over the "battle" (the rat issue).
> "She gets the rats, exactly. She got the rats."

### <span style="color:blue">Key Negotiation Insights from the Case Study</span>

- **Balance of power:** Be aware of the power dynamics in a negotiation.
> "It's a great point. I've, besides her mom had already said yes."
- **The "elephants and ants" approach:**  Sometimes, it's necessary to concede on small issues to achieve a larger goal.
>  "I was willing to lose a battle to win the war."
- **Durable agreements:**  Aim for agreements that are sustainable and built on trust rather than just legal documents.
> "The idea is that your agreement should be durable. There's no point in coming to an agreement that it terminates in a l...  a lawsuit six months later."

### <span style="color:blue">Mindsets for Effective Negotiation</span>

- **Negotiation as a conversation:** Treat negotiations as an exchange of ideas and interests, not a contest.
> "A negotiation is just a conversation. It's just an exchange."
- **Think win-win:** Aim for solutions that benefit both parties.
>  "Thinking win-win." 
- **Accountability:** Recognize the broader consequences of your actions and the interests of all stakeholders.
> "A lot of times, people think, 'It's the negotiate. They're only accountable themselves."
- **Watch your language:** Avoid emotional language, bluffing, or high-velocity words, as they can damage your credibility. 
> "Just you think of the words that just sort of raise people's emotional tension and their temperature."
- **Set a baseline:** Maintain a calm, composed demeanor to increase your influence and maintain control of the situation. 
> "Whatever your baseline is, it's the variation from your baseline that will get effect."
- **Be trusted:**  Build a reputation for fairness, honesty, and reliability to foster long-term relationships and agreements.
> "If the other party can trust you over the long run, you'll develop that brand."

### <span style="color:blue">Choosing Your Negotiators</span>

- **Intermediaries matter:** Select negotiators carefully, considering their impact on your brand and their ability to facilitate deals.
> "Would you use this as a model for buying, for selecting an intermediary?" 
- **Deal facilitators vs. deal makers:**  Look for negotiators who are problem solvers and can help close deals rather than those who simply focus on legal technicalities.
> "Are they deal facilitators? Are they deal makers, problem solvers?"


### <span style="color:blue">Minimizing Intermediaries</span>

- **Avoid using too many intermediaries**:  The speaker prefers direct communication with the other party.
   > *"I don't like to have agents, brokers, investment bankers, or attorneys negotiating my deals."*
- **Maintain a one-on-one relationship**: This approach fosters trust and helps build a stronger brand.
- **Benefits of direct communication**: Creates better relationships and outcomes, even if it requires more effort in the short term.
- **Role of intermediaries**: While they can be valuable, they should act as advisors rather than negotiators.
   > *"I like to have a little bit of a background. So I use them that way. But I never put them and say, 'My attorney will negotiate with your attorney and make a deal.'"*

### <span style="color:blue">Moderating Emotions</span>

- **Authenticity is important**: Being genuine builds trust with the opposing party.
- **Moderate emotional swings**: Avoid extreme reactions and keep emotions in check.
- **Stay within your "thresholds":**  Recognize your personal limits and avoid going beyond them to maintain a good outcome.
    > *"There are certain thresholds that I don't want to cross, because I spend a lot. If I cross those thresholds, I've spent something that doesn't return to me what it's worth."*

### <span style="color:blue">Be Likable</span>

- **Likability matters**: Even in professional settings, a likable demeanor can positively influence negotiations.
    > *"There is something, even the most jaded, professionally trained litigator who does gladiating for a life, you know, says it makes a difference if you like the other party."*
- **No upside in being unpleasant**:  Being a jerk won't get you anywhere in negotiations.

### <span style="color:blue">Formal Negotiation Processes</span>

- **Litigation and arbitration**:  These are undesirable outcomes, often resulting in rigid and inflexible agreements.
- **Mediation**:  A process of compromise where neither party may feel completely satisfied. 
- **Hidden agendas**: Be aware of potential hidden agendas that can surface during the implementation phase. 

### <span style="color:blue">Fisher and Ury's Negotiation Principles</span>

- **Getting to Yes**: A classic book on negotiation strategies written by Fisher and Ury, two Harvard lawyers.
    > *"It's still the classic book on the go, I would recommend it to all of you who want to become a better negotiator."*
- **Getting Past No**: A follow-up book that delves deeper into overcoming negotiation challenges.
    > *"Actually, the second one, though much less read. In fact, is there anybody in here that's read Getting Past No? OK, great. Not very many people have read it. It's actually, I think, even a better, more insightful book."*
- **Four fundamental principles**:
    1. **Separate the people from the problem**: Don't let personal feelings cloud your judgment.
    2. **Focus on interests, not positions**: Understand what the other party truly wants, not just their stated position.
    3. **Invent options for mutual gain**:  Think creatively to find solutions that benefit both sides.
    4. **Insist on objective criteria**:  Establish a set of criteria to assess the fairness of the deal.
- **Know your BATNA (Best Alternative To a Negotiated Agreement):**  Understand your fallback options to avoid accepting unfavorable deals.
    > *"Know what going in, and my corollary to that is calculate the other party's batna."*

### <span style="color:blue">Fisher and Ury's Practical Strategies</span>

- **Don't blame your opponent**: See the situation from their perspective.
- **Give your opponent a stake in the outcome**:  Make them feel invested in the success of the agreement.
- **Don't react to provocation**: Step away from heated situations.
- **Be an active listener**:  Pay attention to what the other party is saying.
- **Agree when you can**:  Start with areas of agreement to build rapport.

### <span style="color:blue">Applying Negotiation Skills to Relationships</span>

- **Marriage**:  Applying negotiation principles can lead to happier and more fulfilling relationships.
    > *"This is how I've made a marriage work for 35 years is basically doing these things."*
- **Other relationships**:  Negotiation skills can be applied to various relationships to improve communication and understanding.

### <span style="color:blue">Key Takeaways</span>

- Building strong relationships is essential for effective negotiation.
- Avoid letting ego or emotion cloud your judgment.
- Focus on mutual gain and finding creative solutions.
- Know your BATNA and be prepared to walk away if necessary.
