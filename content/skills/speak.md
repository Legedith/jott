## How to Speak
**Introduction:**

The speaker starts by emphasizing the importance of communication skills for success in life. They highlight that knowledge, practice, and talent contribute to effective communication, but knowledge is paramount. The speaker promises to share techniques that can improve presentation skills, and outlines a rule of engagement – no laptops or cell phones during the talk.

**Starting a Presentation:**

- Instead of starting with a joke, the speaker recommends using an **empowerment promise**.  [🔉](https://youtu.be/Unzc731iCUY?t=302)
    - > "At the end of this 60 minutes, you will know things about speaking you don't know now. And something among those things you know will make a difference in your life."  [🔉](https://youtu.be/Unzc731iCUY?t=330)
- This sets the stage for the audience by telling them what they will gain from the presentation. [🔉](https://youtu.be/Unzc731iCUY?t=850)

**Heuristics for Effective Presentations:** [🔉](https://youtu.be/Unzc731iCUY?t=578)

- **Cycling:** Repetition is crucial for comprehension, as not everyone will be fully attentive at all times. Saying a point three times helps ensure that all participants grasp the concept.
- **Building a Fence:** Explaining an idea in a way that distinguishes it from similar or related ideas is important. This prevents confusion and helps the audience understand the unique aspects of the presented concept.
    - Example:  "My algorithm seems similar to Jones's algorithm, except his is exponential in mind's linear." [🔉](https://youtu.be/Unzc731iCUY?t=435)
- **Verbal Punctuation:** Providing landmarks in the presentation helps audience members who may have missed parts of the talk to easily get back on track. 
    - Using numbers, lists, and clear transitions makes it easier to follow the flow of the presentation.
- **Asking Questions:** Engaging the audience through thoughtful questions can keep them involved and reinforce the concepts discussed. 
    - Questions should be carefully chosen to avoid embarrassment or confusion.

**Key Takeaway:** Building a repertoire of presentation techniques by observing effective speakers and incorporating their styles is crucial for improving one's own communication skills.

**Time and Place:**

- **Time:** 11 a.m. is a good time for lectures at MIT because people are usually awake and not fatigued from meals or other activities. [🔉](https://youtu.be/Unzc731iCUY?t=646)
- **Place:** 
    - **Well lit:** Dim lighting signals to the brain to go to sleep, hindering attentiveness. [🔉](https://youtu.be/Unzc731iCUY?t=677)
    - **Cased:**  Familiarizing oneself with the speaking space beforehand allows for anticipating and addressing any potential issues or challenges.
    - **Reasonably Populated:** A hall that is more than half full provides a more engaging atmosphere than a sparsely attended one.

**Tools of the Trade:** [🔉](https://youtu.be/Unzc731iCUY?t=818)

- **Blackboards:**
    - **Graphic Quality:** Allows for incorporating visuals and diagrams directly into the presentation.
    - **Speed Property:** The speed of writing on a blackboard aligns with the speed at which people absorb information. [🔉](https://youtu.be/Unzc731iCUY?t=865)
    - **Target:** Provides a focal point for hands, preventing awkwardness and encouraging gesture use.
- **Props:**
    - **Playwrights:**  They masterfully utilize props to enhance storytelling and convey meaning.
    - **Empathetic Mirroring:** Props can engage the audience's mirror neurons, creating a more immersive and memorable experience. [🔉](https://youtu.be/Unzc731iCUY?t=1419)
    - **Example:** Using a bicycle wheel and duct tape to demonstrate the concept of torque and rotational motion. [🔉](https://youtu.be/Unzc731iCUY?t=1135)

- **Slides:** Effective for exposing ideas in a job talk or conference presentation, but not for teaching. [🔉](https://youtu.be/Unzc731iCUY?t=1441)

**Points to Ponder:**

- Why do students prefer more chalk and less PowerPoint? 
- How does empathetic mirroring contribute to the effectiveness of props and blackboards? [🔉](https://youtu.be/Unzc731iCUY?t=1419)

**Key Takeaways:**

- Effective presentation techniques are a combination of knowledge and practice.
- By incorporating heuristics, engaging the audience, and using appropriate tools, speakers can enhance their communication skills and ensure their ideas are effectively delivered.

### Avoiding Common Presentation Crimes 

This section focuses on practical tips and strategies to avoid common mistakes in presentations, especially in technical talks. 

* **The "Too Many Words" Crime**: The most common mistake is having too many words on slides, which can be distracting for the audience and forces them to read instead of listening.  [🔉](https://youtu.be/Unzc731iCUY?t=1660)
    * > **"One of the things you shouldn't do is read your transparencies. People in your audience know how to read, and reading will just annoy them."**  [🔉](https://youtu.be/Unzc731iCUY?t=1551)
    * To fix this, simplify your slides by: [🔉](https://youtu.be/Unzc731iCUY?t=2133)
        * Removing background junk and logos.
        * Reducing the number of words on each slide. [🔉](https://youtu.be/Unzc731iCUY?t=1700)
        * Using a larger font size. [🔉](https://youtu.be/Unzc731iCUY?t=2118)
        * Avoiding unnecessary bullets.
    * > **"A student of mine did an experiment a few years ago. He taught some students some web-based programming ideas. Half the information was on slides. He said the other half. And then for a control group, he reversed it. And the question was, what did the subjects, that is, say, freshman in his fraternity, what did the subjects remember best? What he said, or what they read on the slide? And the answer is, what they read on the slide."**

* **The "Laser Pointer" Crime**:  Using a laser pointer disrupts eye contact and engagement with the audience.  [🔉](https://youtu.be/Unzc731iCUY?t=1875)
    * > **"Look at that. It's a lovely recursive picture. And I can become part of it by putting that laser beam right on the back of my head up there. And what do you see? You see the back of my head. I have no eye contact, no engagement, nothing."** [🔉](https://youtu.be/Unzc731iCUY?t=1843)
    * Instead, consider using arrows or other visual cues on your slides to point out specific elements.

* **The "Too Heavy" Crime**:  This refers to presentations that have too much text and not enough white space or imagery.  [🔉](https://youtu.be/Unzc731iCUY?t=1921)
    * > **"When people ask me to review a presentation, I ask them to print it out and lay it out on a table. When they do that, it's easy to see whether the talk is too heavy, with too much text, not enough air, not enough white space, or not enough imagery."** [🔉](https://youtu.be/Unzc731iCUY?t=1921)
    * Aim for a balance between text and visual elements to make your presentation visually appealing and less overwhelming.

* **The "*Epaxle of Going On*" Crime**:  This term refers to a complex slide that is used only once in a presentation to illustrate a complex concept. 
    * > **"This is an *epaxle of going on*. What that means is this is the kind of slide you can get away with exactly once in your presentation."**  [🔉](https://youtu.be/Unzc731iCUY?t=2008)
    * While useful for introducing a complex idea, avoid using multiple *epaxles of going on* throughout your presentation.

* **The "Hands in the Pockets" Crime**:  This refers to the selection of an inappropriate time and place for giving a presentation.  [🔉](https://youtu.be/Unzc731iCUY?t=2008)
    * The speaker uses the example of the Bartos Theater at MIT, which he describes as a "dark, gloomy place" not ideal for presentations.

* **The "Too Many Conclusion Slides" Crime**:  Having a large number of conclusion slides can indicate that the speaker is not concise and lacks a clear message. 
    * > **"Notice that it starts with words. This is the first of 10 conclusion slides."**  [🔉](https://youtu.be/Unzc731iCUY?t=2133)

### Inspiring Your Audience

* **The Importance of Passion**: The speaker emphasizes the importance of expressing passion about your subject matter, as it can greatly inspire your audience.
    * > **"They were inspired by someone who helped them to see a problem in a new way. And then what I saw from everyone is that they were inspired when someone exhibited passion about what they were doing."** [🔉](https://youtu.be/Unzc731iCUY?t=2257)
* **Providing a Promise**:  Start your presentation with a promise, outlining what your audience will gain from listening. 
    * > **"You want to start with a promise. Like I did for this hour that we're going through now."** [🔉](https://youtu.be/Unzc731iCUY?t=2203)
* **Showcasing the Coolness of Your Work**: Highlight the exciting aspects of your work to capture your audience's attention. 
    * The speaker uses an example of a resource allocation problem involving coloring states on a map. He demonstrates a program that takes a very long time to run, but with a simple adjustment, it becomes incredibly fast.
    * > **"Isn't that cool? You know, you got to be amazed by stuff that takes a computation from longer than the lifetime of the solar system into a few seconds."**  [🔉](https://youtu.be/Unzc731iCUY?t=2389)

### Teaching People How to Think [🔉](https://youtu.be/Unzc731iCUY?t=3618)

* **Storytelling as Thinking**: The speaker emphasizes that humans are storytelling animals and that thinking involves understanding and manipulating stories.
    * > **"I believe that we are storytelling animals. And that we start developing our story understanding and manipulating skills with fairy tales in childhood and continue on through professional schools like law, business, medicine, engineering, everything."** [🔉](https://youtu.be/Unzc731iCUY?t=2448)
* **Educating Through Stories**: To teach people how to think, provide them with stories, questions about those stories, methods for analyzing them, and ways to evaluate their reliability. [🔉](https://youtu.be/Unzc731iCUY?t=2466)

###  Persuading Your Audience

* **Oral Exams**:
    * **Situating Your Work**: Emphasize the context and importance of your research.
    * **Practice Effectively**: Practice your talk with friends or colleagues who are unfamiliar with your work. 
* **Job Talks**:
    * **Express Vision**: Articulate your vision for future research within the first five minutes of your talk. [🔉](https://youtu.be/Unzc731iCUY?t=2736)
    * **Highlight Accomplishments**: Demonstrate that you have made significant contributions in your field. [🔉](https://youtu.be/Unzc731iCUY?t=3361)
    * **Use a Framework**: Follow a structured approach, outlining the problem, approach, steps, and contributions.
* **Getting Famous**:
    * **Seek Recognition**: Consider strategies to gain recognition for your work.  [🔉](https://youtu.be/Unzc731iCUY?t=3545)
    
### Key Takeaways:

* Avoid common presentation crimes such as "Too Many Words," "Laser Pointer," and "Too Heavy."
* Focus on engaging your audience by expressing passion, providing a promise, and highlighting the excitement of your work. 
* Teach people how to think by presenting stories, questions, and analytical methods.  [🔉](https://youtu.be/Unzc731iCUY?t=3765)
* Persuade your audience through clear articulation of your vision, accomplishments, and contributions. 


## Packaging Your Ideas [🔉](https://youtu.be/Unzc731iCUY?t=3593)

### Introduction

This section continues the discussion on presentation techniques by exploring how to package your ideas effectively to ensure they are remembered and recognized. It highlights the importance of presenting ideas in a way that showcases their value and demonstrates their impact.

### Getting Remembered: The Winston-Star Framework

* **Symbol**: A visual representation or tangible artifact that immediately connects with the idea. 
    *  Example: In the speaker's PhD thesis, the art itself served as a symbol for the idea of "one-shot learning." [🔉](https://youtu.be/Unzc731iCUY?t=3094)

* **Slogan**: A catchy phrase or tagline that captures the essence of the idea and provides a memorable handle.
    * Example: "One-shot learning" was the slogan used to describe the concept of learning from a single example.

* **Surprise**: An unexpected element or discovery that makes the idea stand out and sparks interest.  [🔉](https://youtu.be/Unzc731iCUY?t=316)
    * Example: The surprise in the speaker's work was the realization that it was possible to learn definitively from a single example, challenging conventional wisdom.

* **Salient Idea**: A central concept or insight that sticks out and captures the core essence of the idea.  [🔉](https://youtu.be/Unzc731iCUY?t=3694)
    * Example: The salient idea in the speaker's work was the notion of a "near miss" - a concept that was central to the overall approach.

* **Story**: A clear and compelling narrative explaining how the idea works, why it's important, and the journey of its development. 
    * Example: The story in the speaker's work explained the technical process of one-shot learning, its potential applications, and the challenges overcome during its development.

> "Your ideas are like your children. And you don't want them to go into the world in rags." - Speaker [🔉](https://youtu.be/Unzc731iCUY?t=2987)

### Ending Your Presentation: The Contributions Slide and Final Words [🔉](https://youtu.be/Unzc731iCUY?t=2200)

* **Contributions Slide**: This is the final slide and should showcase the key contributions of your work instead of listing conclusions. [🔉](https://youtu.be/Unzc731iCUY?t=2008)
    * Example: The speaker suggests using a slide labeled "Contributions" to highlight the impact and value of their work.

* **Final Words**: These should be impactful and memorable, leaving a positive impression on the audience.
    * **Avoid**: Saying "thank you" as it suggests that the audience was there out of politeness, not genuine interest.  [🔉](https://youtu.be/Unzc731iCUY?t=3488)
    * **Options**: 
        * **Joke**: End on a lighthearted note to create a positive final memory.
        * **"God bless you, and God bless America"**: While a classic ending, it might not be appropriate for all audiences. 
        * **Salute the Audience**: Express gratitude and appreciation for the audience's time and engagement.

> "What they care about is what you have done. And that's why your final slide should have this label: 'Contributions.'" - Speaker [🔉](https://youtu.be/Unzc731iCUY?t=3347)

### Key Takeaways

* Package your ideas effectively using the Winston-Star framework to ensure memorability and recognition.
* End your presentation with a "Contributions" slide to highlight the impact and value of your work.
*  Avoid ending with a simple "thank you" and consider alternative options for a memorable conclusion.

This section emphasizes the importance of presentation techniques not only for communicating ideas effectively but also for making a lasting impression on the audience. By incorporating these strategies, you can ensure that your ideas are not only heard but also remembered and appreciated.
