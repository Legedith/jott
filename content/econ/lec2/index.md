**Introduction**

This lecture delves into the foundation of the demand curve, exploring how consumer preferences and budget constraints shape choices. The main focus is on understanding utility maximization, a core concept in economics.

**Consumer Preferences and Utility Functions** [🔉](https://youtu.be/tCKk22kaZi4?t=903)

- The demand curve arises from consumer decision-making, which can be modeled as utility maximization. [🔉](https://youtu.be/tCKk22kaZi4?t=73)
- **Utility maximization** is the process of making choices that maximize satisfaction given constraints. [🔉](https://youtu.be/tCKk22kaZi4?t=294)
- **Consumer preferences** represent what people want, while **budget constraints** represent what they can afford. [🔉](https://youtu.be/tCKk22kaZi4?t=97)
- The lecture will focus on preferences and their mathematical representation through utility functions. [🔉](https://youtu.be/tCKk22kaZi4?t=1547)
- The assumption of **completeness** means that consumers can always rank their preferences, even if they are indifferent between some options.
- **Transitivity** assumes that if you prefer A to B and B to C, then you prefer A to C. [🔉](https://youtu.be/tCKk22kaZi4?t=278)
- **Non-satiation**, or **more is better**, is a core economic assumption that implies consumers always prefer more to less. [🔉](https://youtu.be/tCKk22kaZi4?t=342)

**Graphical Representation of Preferences: Indifference Curves** [🔉](https://youtu.be/tCKk22kaZi4?t=941)

![Slide 1](/jott/econ/lec2/slide_1.png#center)
- **Indifference curves** are graphical maps of preferences, representing all combinations of goods that a consumer finds equally satisfying. [🔉](https://youtu.be/tCKk22kaZi4?t=535)
- **Example:** Consider preferences for pizza and cookies. [🔉](https://youtu.be/tCKk22kaZi4?t=400)
    - Package A: 2 pizzas, 1 cookie. [🔉](https://youtu.be/tCKk22kaZi4?t=427)
    - Package B: 1 pizza, 2 cookies. [🔉](https://youtu.be/tCKk22kaZi4?t=441)

    - Package C: 2 pizzas, 2 cookies. [🔉](https://youtu.be/tCKk22kaZi4?t=441)
    - Assumption: The consumer is indifferent between A and B but prefers C to both. [🔉](https://youtu.be/tCKk22kaZi4?t=553)
    - The indifference curve connecting A and B represents all combinations where the consumer is equally happy. [🔉](https://youtu.be/tCKk22kaZi4?t=535)
    - Higher indifference curves represent greater utility due to the "more is better" assumption. [🔉](https://youtu.be/tCKk22kaZi4?t=1815)

**Properties of Indifference Curves** [🔉](https://youtu.be/tCKk22kaZi4?t=502)

- **Property 1:** Consumers prefer higher indifference curves. [🔉](https://youtu.be/tCKk22kaZi4?t=581)
- **Property 2:** Indifference curves are downward sloping due to non-satiation. [🔉](https://youtu.be/tCKk22kaZi4?t=647)
    - An upward sloping curve would violate the assumption that more is better. [🔉](https://youtu.be/tCKk22kaZi4?t=302)
    ![Slide 2](/jott/econ/lec2/slide_2.png#center)
- **Property 3:** Indifference curves never cross because this violates transitivity. [🔉](https://youtu.be/tCKk22kaZi4?t=627)
    - If two curves cross, it implies the consumer is indifferent between two bundles, one of which is strictly better than the other.
    ![Slide 3](/jott/econ/lec2/slide_3.png#center)
- **Property 4:** There is only one indifference curve through every possible consumption bundle due to completeness. [🔉](https://youtu.be/tCKk22kaZi4?t=746)
    - Multiple indifference curves through a single bundle would imply uncertainty about the consumer's preferences. [🔉](https://youtu.be/tCKk22kaZi4?t=375)


**Example: Choosing a Job Offer**

- The lecture illustrates how indifference curves can help individuals make decisions, like choosing a job offer. [🔉](https://youtu.be/tCKk22kaZi4?t=618)
    - A grad student considers two job offers, one with a good location (Santa Cruz) and one with a good department (Princeton).
    - He is indifferent between these two offers, but a third offer from the IMF with a better location and department than Princeton but worse than Santa Cruz is considered preferable.

**Utility Functions: Mathematical Representation of Preferences** [🔉](https://youtu.be/tCKk22kaZi4?t=941)
![Slide 4](/jott/econ/lec2/slide_4.png#center)

- **Utility functions** provide a mathematical representation of preferences. [🔉](https://youtu.be/tCKk22kaZi4?t=941)
- **Example:** A utility function for pizza and cookies could be `U = √(pizza * cookies)`. [🔉](https://youtu.be/tCKk22kaZi4?t=1123)
- This function assigns a numerical value to each combination of goods, reflecting the consumer's preferences.
- **Utility** itself is an ordinal concept, meaning it can only be used to rank choices, not to measure absolute levels of satisfaction.
- **Marginal utility** is the derivative of the utility function with respect to a specific good, representing the change in utility from consuming one more unit of that good.

**Key Takeaways**

- Consumer preferences and budget constraints are essential for understanding demand. [🔉](https://youtu.be/tCKk22kaZi4?t=110)
- Indifference curves provide a graphical representation of consumer preferences. [🔉](https://youtu.be/tCKk22kaZi4?t=375)
- Utility functions offer a mathematical representation of preferences, allowing for comparisons and analysis of choice. [🔉](https://youtu.be/tCKk22kaZi4?t=142)
- Marginal utility helps quantify the additional satisfaction from consuming one more unit of a good. [🔉](https://youtu.be/tCKk22kaZi4?t=1179)

**Points to Ponder**

- How do real-world factors, like time constraints or psychological biases, influence consumer preferences? [🔉](https://youtu.be/tCKk22kaZi4?t=351)
- Can utility functions accurately capture the complexity of human desires? [🔉](https://youtu.be/tCKk22kaZi4?t=1407)
- What are the limitations of using a two-dimensional model to represent consumer preferences? [🔉](https://youtu.be/tCKk22kaZi4?t=351)

**Facts/Trivia/Tidbits**

- The assumption of non-satiation is a simplification. In reality, individuals can experience satiation for certain goods.
- The concept of utility maximization has been influential in economics and has implications for understanding market behavior and policy design.

**Next Lecture**

The next lecture will focus on the budget constraint, which will combine with the concept of utility functions to understand consumer choices in a constrained environment.


## Diminishing Marginal Utility and Indifference Curves [🔉](https://youtu.be/tCKk22kaZi4?t=1627)

### Introduction

This section delves deeper into the concept of marginal decision-making and diminishing marginal utility, connecting it with indifference curves and the marginal rate of substitution. [🔉](https://youtu.be/tCKk22kaZi4?t=1904)

### Diminishing Marginal Utility

* **Focus on marginal decisions:** It's easier to consider "do I want the next unit?" rather than "how many do I want?". This simplifies decision-making.
* **Diminishing marginal utility:** As you consume more of a good, the additional happiness you get from each unit decreases.  **"The more of a good you've had, the less happiness you'll derive from the next unit."**
* **Graphical Representation (Figure 2.4):**
    ![Slide 4](/jott/econ/lec2/slide_4.png#center)
    * **X-axis:** Number of cookies (holding pizza constant) [🔉](https://youtu.be/tCKk22kaZi4?t=1198)
    * **Y-axis:** Utility (measured in utils, where the specific number doesn't matter, it's ordinal)
    * **Observation:** Utility increases with more cookies, but the increase gets smaller with each additional cookie, demonstrating diminishing marginal utility. [🔉](https://youtu.be/tCKk22kaZi4?t=2154)
* **Measuring Marginal Utility (Figure 2.5):** [🔉](https://youtu.be/tCKk22kaZi4?t=1627)
![Slide 4](/jott/econ/lec2/slide_5.png#center)
    * **Y-axis:** Marginal utility, the change in utility from consuming one more unit. [🔉](https://youtu.be/tCKk22kaZi4?t=1722)
    * **Observation:** Marginal utility decreases with each additional cookie. [🔉](https://youtu.be/tCKk22kaZi4?t=1123)
* **More is Better:** Even with diminishing marginal utility, you always want more of a good, because you can always give it away or throw it out. 
    > "You don't have to eat the eleventh cookie, you can give it away."  [🔉](https://youtu.be/tCKk22kaZi4?t=1365)
* **Exceptions:** In extreme cases, too much of a good can make you worse off (e.g., barfing from too many cookies). But this is outside the scope of typical economic models.

### Indifference Curves
![Slide 6](/jott/econ/lec2/slide_6.png#center)
* **Graphical Representation:** Indifference curves represent the combinations of two goods that give you the same level of utility.  [🔉](https://youtu.be/tCKk22kaZi4?t=535)
* **Marginal Rate of Substitution (MRS):** The slope of the indifference curve, representing the rate at which you're willing to trade one good for another. It's defined as `delta P / delta C`, where P is the quantity of pizza and C is the quantity of cookies.
* **Diminishing MRS:** The MRS diminishes as you move along the indifference curve. This is due to diminishing marginal utility. [🔉](https://youtu.be/tCKk22kaZi4?t=1669)
    > "You are more and more willing to give up the good on the excess to get the good on the y-axis." [🔉](https://youtu.be/tCKk22kaZi4?t=1792)
* **Key Insight:**  The MRS is equal to the negative of the marginal utility of cookies divided by the marginal utility of pizza: `MRS = -MU(cookies) / MU(pizza)`. [🔉](https://youtu.be/tCKk22kaZi4?t=1669)
    * **Explanation:** When you have a lot of pizza, its marginal utility is low, and you're willing to give up more of it to get more cookies. As you move down the indifference curve, you have less pizza and more cookies, so the marginal utility of pizza increases, making you less willing to give it up.
* **Convexity:** Indifference curves are convex to the origin due to the diminishing MRS.  [🔉](https://youtu.be/tCKk22kaZi4?t=1815)
    > "Indifference curves are convex to the origin." [🔉](https://youtu.be/tCKk22kaZi4?t=1815)
* **Concavity:** Indifference curves cannot be concave to the origin, because this would violate the principle of diminishing marginal utility and the diminishing MRS. [🔉](https://youtu.be/tCKk22kaZi4?t=1904)
    > "A concave to the origin indifference curve would violate the principle of diminishing marginal utility and diminishing marginal rate of substitution." [🔉](https://youtu.be/tCKk22kaZi4?t=1904)
![Slide 6](/jott/econ/lec2/slide_7.png#center)
### Points to Ponder

* **Decision Set:** What is the set of decisions over which our utility function applies? This can be a complex question, especially when dealing with unique preferences (e.g., trading card collections).
* **Addiction:** Addiction can be modeled as a shifting utility function, where the value of the addictive good increases with addiction, rather than simply diminishing marginal utility.

### Key Takeaways

* Marginal decision-making and diminishing marginal utility are key concepts in economics. [🔉](https://youtu.be/tCKk22kaZi4?t=1123)
* Indifference curves are graphical representations of utility functions, and the MRS captures the tradeoff between two goods. [🔉](https://youtu.be/tCKk22kaZi4?t=548)
* The diminishing MRS is a consequence of diminishing marginal utility. [🔉](https://youtu.be/tCKk22kaZi4?t=1393)
* The shape of the indifference curve (convexity) reflects the diminishing MRS and the principle of diminishing marginal utility. [🔉](https://youtu.be/tCKk22kaZi4?t=1904)

### Facts/Trivia/Tidbits

* Accidental overdoses in the US are now higher than traffic fatalities.
* The prices of different sizes of goods in convenience stores (e.g., Starbucks coffee, McDonald's drinks) reflect the principle of diminishing marginal utility.

### Applying Diminishing Marginal Utility to Real-World Examples: [🔉](https://youtu.be/tCKk22kaZi4?t=1627)

* **The Case of Sodas:**  [🔉](https://youtu.be/tCKk22kaZi4?t=1826)
    * The speaker uses the example of sodas to illustrate how diminishing marginal utility impacts pricing. [🔉](https://youtu.be/tCKk22kaZi4?t=1171)

    * The supply curve for sodas is slightly upward sloping, indicating that the cost of producing each additional 16 ounces is slightly higher.
    * The demand curve for sodas is downward sloping, indicating that as the quantity of soda consumed increases, the willingness to pay for each additional unit decreases. [🔉](https://youtu.be/tCKk22kaZi4?t=2238)
    * **The price difference between sizes:** The speaker explains that the price difference between different sizes of soda reflects diminishing marginal utility. For example, the price increase for a 32-ounce soda is significantly lower than the initial 16-ounce price. This is because consumers are willing to pay less for the second 16 ounces due to diminishing marginal utility.
    * **The "Monster Gulp":** The speaker points out that the pricing of extremely large sodas at convenience stores, like the "Monster Gulp," reflects diminishing marginal utility.  The price difference between a large soda and a smaller one is minimal because the consumer's willingness to pay for additional ounces decreases significantly as the size increases.

### Discussion: Applicability to Other Products and Perishability

* **A Student Question:** A student asks about the application of diminishing marginal utility to products like stamps.  The student points out that the cost of buying stamps in bulk is less than buying them individually. This, the student suggests, implies that diminishing marginal utility does not apply to stamps.
* **The Speaker's Response:** The speaker acknowledges the student's point but argues that the lower price of bulk stamps is more related to packaging efficiencies and rigidity rather than diminishing marginal utility.  He further suggests that comparing prices of perishable vs. non-perishable products in bulk may provide a better understanding of the role of diminishing marginal utility.
* **Perishability and Pricing:**  The speaker highlights the significance of perishability in influencing pricing decisions.  The example of refillable sodas at sporting events like Fenway Park demonstrates the impact of perishability on pricing. The price of a refillable soda, although more expensive than a regular-sized soda, allows for multiple refills, making it more cost-effective for consumers who plan to consume multiple sodas within a short time frame.
* **The Role of "Non-Linearity":**  The speaker points out the complexities of considering factors beyond linear models when examining diminishing marginal utility. For instance, the perishability of goods and packaging efficiencies can significantly impact pricing and demand.

### Key Takeaways:

* Diminishing marginal utility plays a significant role in influencing pricing decisions. [🔉](https://youtu.be/tCKk22kaZi4?t=2057)
* The price difference between different sizes of goods reflects the principle of diminishing marginal utility. [🔉](https://youtu.be/tCKk22kaZi4?t=1393)
* Perishability and packaging efficiencies can also influence pricing and demand.
* The application of diminishing marginal utility to real-world situations can be complex and may require considering factors beyond linear models.
