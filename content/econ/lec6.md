**Introduction:**

This lecture continues the discussion of producer theory, building upon the foundation of consumer theory and demand curves. The objective is to develop a cost curve that demonstrates how the cost of production varies with output, starting with the short run and then moving to the long run.

**Short-Run Cost Curve**

- **Key Idea:** The short run cost curve is determined by the interaction of fixed costs (from capital) and variable costs (from labor). [🔉](https://youtu.be/TSYNHb6YBEE?t=135)
- **Production Function:**  The lecture utilizes the production function `q = √(L * K)`  where `q` is the quantity of goods produced, `L` is the amount of labor, and `K` is the amount of capital.  [🔉](https://youtu.be/TSYNHb6YBEE?t=2604)
    - **Labor:** Variable input, adjustable in both the short run and long run. [🔉](https://youtu.be/TSYNHb6YBEE?t=100)
    - **Capital:** Fixed input, adjustable only in the long run. [🔉](https://youtu.be/TSYNHb6YBEE?t=106)
- **Cost Components:**
    - **Fixed Costs:** Costs associated with fixed capital, which cannot be changed in the short run. [🔉](https://youtu.be/TSYNHb6YBEE?t=106)
    - **Variable Costs:** Costs associated with labor, which can be adjusted in the short run. [🔉](https://youtu.be/TSYNHb6YBEE?t=789)
    - **Total Costs:**  Fixed costs + Variable costs. [🔉](https://youtu.be/TSYNHb6YBEE?t=135)
- **Derivation of Short-Run Cost Function:** [🔉](https://youtu.be/TSYNHb6YBEE?t=429)
    - **Relationship:** The cost function is derived directly from the production function and the prices of labor and capital. [🔉](https://youtu.be/TSYNHb6YBEE?t=476)
    - **Assumptions:**
        - Rental rate of capital (r) = $10 [🔉](https://youtu.be/TSYNHb6YBEE?t=386)
        - Wage rate of labor (w) = $5 [🔉](https://youtu.be/TSYNHb6YBEE?t=325)
    - **Steps:**
        1. **Inverting the production function:** `L = q^2 / K` (for a fixed level of capital `K`). [🔉](https://youtu.be/TSYNHb6YBEE?t=115)
        2. **Substituting in the cost equation:** `C = 10K + 5q^2 / K`
        - **Example:**  If `K = 1`, then `C = 10 + 5q^2`.
    - **Result:** The cost function is composed of a fixed cost component (10) and a variable cost component (5q^2), demonstrating the dependence on output.
- **Key Concepts:**
    - **Marginal Cost (MC):** The cost of producing one additional unit of output (ΔC/Δq). [🔉](https://youtu.be/TSYNHb6YBEE?t=530)
![Slide 2](/jott/econ/lec6/slide_2.png#center)
    - **Average Cost (AC):** The total cost divided by the number of units produced (C/q). [🔉](https://youtu.be/TSYNHb6YBEE?t=569)
    - **Relationship Between MC and AC:** MC intersects AC at the minimum point of the AC curve. This is because before the intersection, AC is above MC (due to fixed cost being spread out over more units), and after the intersection, AC is below MC (as variable cost becomes dominant).

**Graphical Representation**

- **Figure 6.1:** Illustrates the short-run cost curves for the derived cost function. [🔉](https://youtu.be/TSYNHb6YBEE?t=552)
    - **MC:**  The marginal cost curve is upward sloping due to the quadratic term in the cost function. [🔉](https://youtu.be/TSYNHb6YBEE?t=888)
    - **AC:** The average cost curve first declines (due to the decreasing average fixed costs) and then rises (due to increasing marginal costs). [🔉](https://youtu.be/TSYNHb6YBEE?t=652)
    - **Average Fixed Costs (AFC):**  The fixed costs divided by the number of units produced, represented by the curve 10/q.
    - **Average Variable Costs (AVC):** The variable costs divided by the number of units produced, represented by the curve 5q. [🔉](https://youtu.be/TSYNHb6YBEE?t=148)

**Marginal Cost and Marginal Product of Labor** [🔉](https://youtu.be/TSYNHb6YBEE?t=804)

- **Key Relationship:**  There's a close relationship between the marginal cost of production and the marginal product of labor. [🔉](https://youtu.be/TSYNHb6YBEE?t=797)
    - **Marginal Product of Labor (MPL):** The increase in output for each additional unit of labor (Δq/Δl). [🔉](https://youtu.be/TSYNHb6YBEE?t=912)
    - **Deriving the Relationship:**
        1. `MC = ΔC/Δq`
        2. `Δq/Δl = MPL`
        3. Rewriting `ΔC/Δq` as `w * (Δl/Δq)` (where `w` is the wage). [🔉](https://youtu.be/TSYNHb6YBEE?t=278)
        4. Combining equations: `MC = w / MPL`
- **Interpretation:** 
    - Marginal cost is higher when the wage is higher, and lower when the marginal product of labor is higher.  [🔉](https://youtu.be/TSYNHb6YBEE?t=912)
    - High-skilled workers might be more expensive, but their higher productivity can make their marginal cost lower. [🔉](https://youtu.be/TSYNHb6YBEE?t=586)

**Long-Run Cost Curves**

![Slide 3](/jott/econ/lec6/slide_3.png#center)
- **Key Idea:**  In the long run, capital is variable, and the firm can choose the optimal input mix (labor and capital) to minimize the cost of producing a given quantity. [🔉](https://youtu.be/TSYNHb6YBEE?t=1040)
- **Optimal Input Mix:** The economically efficient combination of labor and capital that minimizes costs. [🔉](https://youtu.be/TSYNHb6YBEE?t=1066)
- **ISO Cost Curves:** 
    - **Definition:**  Represents different combinations of labor and capital that cost the same amount. [🔉](https://youtu.be/TSYNHb6YBEE?t=1126)
    - **Equation:** `C = WL + RK` 
    - **Similar to:** Budget constraints in consumer theory. [🔉](https://youtu.be/TSYNHb6YBEE?t=1092)
    - **Graphical Representation:**  A series of lines with a slope of `-W/R`, showing the possible combinations of labor and capital that a firm can afford.
    - **Important Note:** The slope of the ISO cost curve reflects the relative prices of labor and capital. [🔉](https://youtu.be/TSYNHb6YBEE?t=1189)
- **Determining the Optimal Input Mix:**  [🔉](https://youtu.be/TSYNHb6YBEE?t=1010)
    - The firm will choose the combination of labor and capital that produces the desired output level on the lowest possible ISO cost curve. This means the firm will find the point where the ISO cost curve is tangent to the isoquant (curve representing all combinations of labor and capital that produce the same quantity).

**Conclusion**

The lecture lays the groundwork for understanding cost curves in the short run and long run. It demonstrates how to derive the cost function from the production function and prices, and introduces key concepts like marginal cost, average cost, and the relationship between marginal cost and the marginal product of labor. The next steps will involve exploring the optimal input mix in the long run and analyzing how cost curves influence firm behavior in the market. 


## Long-Run Cost Minimization and Expansion Path [🔉](https://youtu.be/TSYNHb6YBEE?t=1381)

This section delves into the process of determining the optimal combination of capital and labor to minimize costs in the long run. It builds upon the understanding of production functions and cost functions established in the previous sections.

###  Optimal Input Mix

* **Tangency Condition:** The optimal mix of capital and labor is determined by the tangency point between the **isoclont** and the **isocost curve** (Figure 6.3). [🔉](https://youtu.be/TSYNHb6YBEE?t=1293)
    * **Isoclont:** Represents all possible combinations of capital and labor that yield a specific level of production. Analogous to an indifference curve in consumer theory. [🔉](https://youtu.be/TSYNHb6YBEE?t=1362)
    * **Isocost curve:** Represents all possible combinations of capital and labor that can be purchased with a given budget.  Analogous to a budget constraint in consumer theory. [🔉](https://youtu.be/TSYNHb6YBEE?t=1346)

![Slide 4](/jott/econ/lec6/slide_4.png#center)
* **Marginal Rate of Technical Substitution (MRTS):** The slope of the isoclont, representing the rate at which capital can be substituted for labor while maintaining the same level of output. It's defined as the negative of the ratio of the marginal product of labor (MPL) to the marginal product of capital (MPK):  `-MPL / MPK`. [🔉](https://youtu.be/TSYNHb6YBEE?t=1402)
* **Wage-Rental Rate Ratio (w/r):** The slope of the isocost curve, representing the relative price of labor to capital. [🔉](https://youtu.be/TSYNHb6YBEE?t=1189)

* **Optimal Condition:** At the optimal point, the MRTS equals the wage-rental rate ratio:  [🔉](https://youtu.be/TSYNHb6YBEE?t=1441)
    > `-MPL / MPK = -w/r`
* **Intuitive Interpretation:** "Should I spend the next dollar on wages or machines?" This condition implies that the optimal input mix is achieved when the marginal product per dollar spent on labor equals the marginal product per dollar spent on capital. [🔉](https://youtu.be/TSYNHb6YBEE?t=1402)

###  Derivation of the Cost Function  [🔉](https://youtu.be/TSYNHb6YBEE?t=424)

The lecture demonstrates how to derive the cost function using a specific example with a production function `q = √(k * l)`, a wage rate of $5, and a rental rate of $10. [🔉](https://youtu.be/TSYNHb6YBEE?t=1973)

**Steps:**

1. **Production Function:** `q = √(k * l)` [🔉](https://youtu.be/TSYNHb6YBEE?t=1045)
2. **Optimal Input Ratio:**  From the tangency condition, `k = 1/2 * l` (derived from `-MPL / MPK = -w/r`) [🔉](https://youtu.be/TSYNHb6YBEE?t=1293)
3. **Rewrite q:**  Substitute `k = 1/2 * l` into the production function: `q = √(1/2 * l^2)`. [🔉](https://youtu.be/TSYNHb6YBEE?t=331)
4. **Solve for l and k:**  `l = √(2 * q)` and `k = √(2/2 * q) = √(q)`
5. **Cost Function:** Substitute the optimal `l` and `k` into the cost function `C = w*l + r*k`:  [🔉](https://youtu.be/TSYNHb6YBEE?t=1101)
    `C = 5√(2 * q) + 10√(q)` 
    `C = 10√(2 * q) + 10√(q)` 

### Changes in Input Prices

The lecture explores the impact of changes in input prices on the optimal input mix, using the concept of the **substitution effect**.

* **Substitution Effect:**  For a given level of production (isoclont), a rise in the wage rate (w) will lead to a shift along the isoclont towards using fewer workers and more machines.   [🔉](https://youtu.be/TSYNHb6YBEE?t=2246)

> This demonstrates the theoretical basis for the argument that a minimum wage could lead to firms substituting workers with machines.

* **Impact on Total Cost:**  While the substitution effect maintains the same production level, the total cost of production will increase due to the higher wage rate. [🔉](https://youtu.be/TSYNHb6YBEE?t=1973)

### The Long-Run Expansion Path
![Slide 5](/jott/econ/lec6/slide_5.png#center)

The **long-run expansion path** illustrates how the optimal mix of inputs changes as production increases. [🔉](https://youtu.be/TSYNHb6YBEE?t=2517)

* **Linear Long-Run Expansion Path:**  In the given example, the long-run expansion path is linear, meaning that the optimal ratio of workers to machines remains constant regardless of the production level. This is due to the specific production function and the fixed input price ratio.
* **General Case:**  In general, the long-run expansion path can be non-linear, depending on the production function and input prices. [🔉](https://youtu.be/TSYNHb6YBEE?t=480)

### Key Takeaways

* The optimal combination of capital and labor is determined by the tangency condition between the isoclont and the isocost curve. [🔉](https://youtu.be/TSYNHb6YBEE?t=1293)
* The long-run cost function can be derived by substituting the optimal input mix into the cost function. [🔉](https://youtu.be/TSYNHb6YBEE?t=338)
* Changes in input prices can lead to a substitution effect, where firms adjust their input mix to minimize costs.
* The long-run expansion path illustrates how the optimal mix of inputs evolves as production increases.  [🔉](https://youtu.be/TSYNHb6YBEE?t=2517)


## Long-Run Cost Minimization and Expansion Path (Continued)

**Summary:** This section delves into the relationship between long-run cost minimization and the expansion path. The lecture discusses how the shape of the expansion path can vary depending on the production function, demonstrating that different production processes can have different cost structures. It emphasizes the key takeaway that long-run costs are always lower than short-run costs due to the additional degree of freedom in choosing the optimal plant size.

### The Shape of the Long-Run Expansion Path [🔉](https://youtu.be/TSYNHb6YBEE?t=739)

* The **long-run expansion path** shows the optimal combination of inputs (labor and capital) for different production levels. [🔉](https://youtu.be/TSYNHb6YBEE?t=1362)
* This path **does not have to be linear**, and its shape depends on the production function. [🔉](https://youtu.be/TSYNHb6YBEE?t=1530)
* **Example 6.5 B:** When capital becomes less productive as production increases (e.g., a fast-food restaurant where workers can share tasks more efficiently), the expansion path may curve downwards.
* **Example 6.5 C:** When labor becomes less productive relative to capital (e.g., heavy machinery where workers primarily operate machines), the expansion path may curve upwards. 
* These examples illustrate that the expansion path reflects the **relative productivity of inputs** as production scales up.

### Long-Run Expansion Path and Cost Curve [🔉](https://youtu.be/TSYNHb6YBEE?t=998)

* The long-run expansion path **determines the long-run cost curve**. [🔉](https://youtu.be/TSYNHb6YBEE?t=2517)
* For each level of production, the expansion path indicates the optimal combination of inputs. [🔉](https://youtu.be/TSYNHb6YBEE?t=2706)
* Given the prices of labor and capital, this optimal input mix corresponds to a specific cost. [🔉](https://youtu.be/TSYNHb6YBEE?t=1040)
* By tracing out these costs across different production levels, we obtain the long-run cost curve. [🔉](https://youtu.be/TSYNHb6YBEE?t=2863)

### Long-Run vs. Short-Run Costs [🔉](https://youtu.be/TSYNHb6YBEE?t=998)

![Slide 6](/jott/econ/lec6/slide_6.png#center)
* **Key Insight:** Long-run costs are always lower than or equal to short-run costs. [🔉](https://youtu.be/TSYNHb6YBEE?t=2742)
* This is because firms have more flexibility in the long run to choose the optimal plant size. [🔉](https://youtu.be/TSYNHb6YBEE?t=2899)
* **Short-run cost curves:** Reflect the cost of production for a fixed plant size. [🔉](https://youtu.be/TSYNHb6YBEE?t=528)
* **Long-run cost curve:** Represents the minimum cost of production for each level of output, considering the possibility of choosing the optimal plant size.

### Short-Run Average Cost Curves (SRACs) [🔉](https://youtu.be/TSYNHb6YBEE?t=712)

* A firm can have multiple SRAC curves, each representing a different plant size.
* **SRAC1:** Represents the average cost curve for the smallest plant. [🔉](https://youtu.be/TSYNHb6YBEE?t=552)
* **SRAC2:** Represents the average cost curve for the medium-sized plant. [🔉](https://youtu.be/TSYNHb6YBEE?t=689)
* **SRAC3:** Represents the average cost curve for the largest plant. [🔉](https://youtu.be/TSYNHb6YBEE?t=552)
* For low production levels, SRAC1 is the most efficient.
* For higher production levels, SRAC3 becomes more efficient.

### Long-Run Average Cost Curve (LRAC) [🔉](https://youtu.be/TSYNHb6YBEE?t=998)

* The LRAC is the lower envelope of the SRAC curves. [🔉](https://youtu.be/TSYNHb6YBEE?t=1377)
* It represents the **minimum average cost of production** for each output level, considering the possibility of choosing the optimal plant size.
* In the long run, the firm can choose the plant size that minimizes its average cost for the desired production level. [🔉](https://youtu.be/TSYNHb6YBEE?t=2899)

### Tesla Example: Long-Run Optimization [🔉](https://youtu.be/TSYNHb6YBEE?t=3024)

* **Tesla's initial production**: They built a small plant (SRAC1) to produce 20,000 cars, expecting that to be their demand. [🔉](https://youtu.be/TSYNHb6YBEE?t=2932)
* **Actual demand**: Turned out to be much higher (200,000 cars), leading to long waitlists and inefficient production.
* **Tesla's reoptimization**: They are now building a larger battery plant (SRAC3) in Nevada to accommodate the higher demand and optimize production costs. 
* **Potential for future reoptimization**: If demand drops, Tesla could return to a smaller plant in the future.
* **Key takeaway**: Tesla's experience illustrates the importance of long-run cost optimization, which allows firms to adapt to changing demand and production needs.
