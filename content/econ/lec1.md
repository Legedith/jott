### Introduction

This lecture is the first in a microeconomics course taught by Professor John Gruber. The lecture covers course details, the essence of microeconomics, and a foundational concept - supply and demand.

### Course Details

* The course will have a distinct **policy angle**, emphasizing the role of government policy in economics. [🔉](https://youtu.be/_OkTw766oCs?t=31)
* A separate course, **1441**, delves deeper into economic policy.
* The professor encourages active participation and questions, emphasizing the importance of understanding concepts rather than memorizing notes.

### What is Microeconomics?

* Microeconomics is the study of how **individuals and firms make decisions** in a world of **scarcity**. [🔉](https://youtu.be/_OkTw766oCs?t=207)
* It is essentially a series of **constrained optimization exercises** where economic agents strive to make themselves as well off as possible given their constraints. [🔉](https://youtu.be/_OkTw766oCs?t=223)
* The course focuses on **trade-offs** and the concept of **opportunity cost**. [🔉](https://youtu.be/_OkTw766oCs?t=293)
* > "Every action or every inaction has a cost, and that you could have been doing something else instead." [🔉](https://youtu.be/_OkTw766oCs?t=308)

### Opportunity Cost and the "Dismal Science" [🔉](https://youtu.be/_OkTw766oCs?t=327)

* **Opportunity cost** is the value of the next best alternative foregone.  [🔉](https://youtu.be/_OkTw766oCs?t=322)
* Economics is often called the "dismal science" because it emphasizes that nothing is free and there's always a trade-off. [🔉](https://youtu.be/_OkTw766oCs?t=342)
* The professor sees this as a fun challenge, similar to the **constrained optimization** principles found in engineering. [🔉](https://youtu.be/_OkTw766oCs?t=1939)

###  Microeconomics as Engineering Applied to Life [🔉](https://youtu.be/_OkTw766oCs?t=410)

* Microeconomics is like **engineering** applied to people's lives and businesses.
* Modern economics, developed at MIT, applies engineering principles to understand economic phenomena. [🔉](https://youtu.be/_OkTw766oCs?t=367)

### The Supply and Demand Model

* The course will use **simplified models** to explain complex economic phenomena.
* Models are not laws but useful tools for understanding real-world situations.
* The **supply and demand model** is a fundamental tool in economics. [🔉](https://youtu.be/_OkTw766oCs?t=466)
* The model is based on the **water diamond paradox**, where water, essential for life, is cheap, while diamonds, frivolous, are expensive. [🔉](https://youtu.be/_OkTw766oCs?t=704)

### Understanding Supply and Demand

* **Demand curve:** Represents the relationship between the price of a good and how much people want it. It is **downward sloping** because people want less of a good at higher prices. [🔉](https://youtu.be/_OkTw766oCs?t=834)
* **Supply curve:** Represents the relationship between the price of a good and how much firms are willing to supply. It is **upward sloping** because firms want to produce more of a good at higher prices.
* **Equilibrium:** The point where supply and demand curves intersect. It represents a price and quantity where both consumers and producers are happy to make a transaction. [🔉](https://youtu.be/_OkTw766oCs?t=908)
* The professor will delve deeper into the derivation of both the demand and supply curves in future lectures. [🔉](https://youtu.be/_OkTw766oCs?t=864)

### Positive vs. Normative Analysis

* **Positive analysis:** The study of how things **are**. [🔉](https://youtu.be/_OkTw766oCs?t=1008)
* **Normative analysis:** The study of how things **should be**. [🔉](https://youtu.be/_OkTw766oCs?t=1008)

###  eBay Auctions: An Example

* eBay auctions are an example of a **competitive market** where supply and demand forces determine equilibrium. [🔉](https://youtu.be/_OkTw766oCs?t=902)
* The case of someone offering their kidney for auction raises both positive and normative questions. [🔉](https://youtu.be/_OkTw766oCs?t=1068)

### Positive Analysis of Kidney Auction

* **Positive question:** Why did the price of the kidney go so high? [🔉](https://youtu.be/_OkTw766oCs?t=1098)
* **Answer:** High demand (essential for survival) and low supply (few people willing to sell their kidneys).

This is the end of Chunk 1.



## Microeconomics: A Deeper Dive into Markets and the Invisible Hand [🔉](https://youtu.be/_OkTw766oCs?t=1814)

### Summary:

This section explores the complexities of markets beyond the basic supply and demand model. The discussion delves into the controversial topic of organ sales, highlighting potential market failures, equity concerns, and the influence of behavioral economics. It then broadens the scope to compare capitalistic and command economies, emphasizing the strengths and weaknesses of each system. Finally, it outlines the semester's course structure, emphasizing the importance of understanding the fundamental economic framework before drawing conclusions.

### Organ Sales: Exploring the Ethical and Practical Dilemmas

* **The Positive vs. Normative Debate:** 
    * **Positive question:** What are the economic consequences of allowing organ sales?
    * **Normative question:** Should organ sales be allowed? [🔉](https://youtu.be/_OkTw766oCs?t=1143)
* **Standard Economic Argument for Organ Sales:**
    > "You can't just say, look, here's a transaction that makes both parties better off."  [🔉](https://youtu.be/_OkTw766oCs?t=1189)
    - The individual receiving the kidney gets to live.
    - The individual selling the kidney benefits financially. 
    - Most people can live healthy lives with one kidney.
* **Counterarguments to Organ Sales:**
    * **Market Failures:**
        - **Fraud:** Difficulty in verifying the legitimacy of organs.
        - **Imperfect information:** Lack of comprehensive knowledge about the risks associated with selling a kidney.
    * **Equity Concerns:**
        - Only wealthy individuals would be able to afford organ transplants.
        - Current system prioritizes organ allocation based on waiting lists, which may not be the most efficient method.
    * **Behavioral Economics:**
        - Individuals may make irrational decisions when under financial pressure, potentially leading to regret later.
        - Example: A family in extreme poverty might sell a kidney to secure financial stability. 
    * **Inelastic Demand:** The demand for organs is always high, which may not be a problem per se but contributes to high prices.

### Capitalism vs. Command Economies: A Spectrum of Market Regulation [🔉](https://youtu.be/_OkTw766oCs?t=1697)

* **Capitalistic Economy:** 
    - Individuals and firms decide what to produce and consume. [🔉](https://youtu.be/_OkTw766oCs?t=1948)
    - Minimal government intervention to prevent fraud and misinformation. [🔉](https://youtu.be/_OkTw766oCs?t=1614)
    - Leads to economic growth but can lead to inequality.
    > "America was not a wealthy nation. It was not a very wealthy nation 100 years ago, 150 years ago. Led to tremendous growth where we are now the most powerful, still the most powerful, and wealthiest nation in the world." [🔉](https://youtu.be/_OkTw766oCs?t=1632)
    > "We are a nation with tremendous inequality. We are by far the most unequal major nation in the world." [🔉](https://youtu.be/_OkTw766oCs?t=1632)
* **Command Economy:**
    - Government controls all production and consumption decisions.
    - Example: The Soviet Union before 1989.
    - Aims for equity but often leads to inefficiency, corruption, and economic stagnation.
    > "The command model simply doesn't work. Partly, there's just too many opportunities for corruption. When the government controls everything, that means there's no checks and balances on the the the opportunity for enormous corruption." [🔉](https://youtu.be/_OkTw766oCs?t=1770)

### The Invisible Hand: Adam Smith's Core Principle

* **Invisible Hand:** The idea that individuals and firms pursuing their own self-interest unintentionally benefit society. [🔉](https://youtu.be/_OkTw766oCs?t=1823)
    > "Consumers and firms serving their own best interest will do what ends up being best for society." [🔉](https://youtu.be/_OkTw766oCs?t=1823)
    - Example: In a free market, consumers will demand the goods and services they desire, leading firms to produce those products.
* **Definition of "Best for Society":**
    - Initially defined as maximizing production and consumption of goods.
    - Later discussions will expand to consider pollution, health, and other factors.
* **Limitations of the Invisible Hand:**
    - Can lead to inequitable outcomes.
    - Requires a well-functioning market with minimal market failures.

### Course Structure and Expectations

* **Course Focus:** Understanding the workings of the invisible hand, analyzing market failures, and exploring alternative economic models.
* **Key Topics:**
    - Demand: How consumers make decisions based on their resources and preferences. [🔉](https://youtu.be/_OkTw766oCs?t=1704)
