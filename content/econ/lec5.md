## Introduction & Production Functions [🔉](https://youtu.be/ftmvsahQ6Wo?t=511)

**Summary:** This lecture introduces the concept of producer theory, focusing on production functions and their relationship to the supply curve. We explore the key differences between consumer theory and producer theory, focusing on profit maximization through cost minimization by producing efficiently. The lecture also defines input factors of production, introduces the concepts of short run and long run, and explains the diminishing marginal product of labor.

###  Consumer Theory vs. Producer Theory [🔉](https://youtu.be/ftmvsahQ6Wo?t=42)

* **Consumer Theory:** Focuses on how consumers maximize their utility with given income and prices.
* **Producer Theory:** Focuses on how producers maximize their profits, which involves making decisions about their output levels. [🔉](https://youtu.be/ftmvsahQ6Wo?t=106)
    * **Profit Maximization:** Revenue - Costs [🔉](https://youtu.be/ftmvsahQ6Wo?t=97)
    * **Focus on Efficiency:** Minimizing costs through efficient production. [🔉](https://youtu.be/ftmvsahQ6Wo?t=132)

###  Production Functions: Converting Inputs into Outputs [🔉](https://youtu.be/ftmvsahQ6Wo?t=640)

* **General Form:**  `Q = f(L, K)` 
    * **Q:** Units of goods produced. [🔉](https://youtu.be/ftmvsahQ6Wo?t=983)
    * **L:** Labor input (number of workers or hours of work). [🔉](https://youtu.be/ftmvsahQ6Wo?t=239)
    * **K:** Capital input (machines, land, buildings). [🔉](https://youtu.be/ftmvsahQ6Wo?t=250)
    * **Key Difference:**  Production functions are *technological* in nature, unlike utility functions, which reflect preferences.
* **Factors of Production:**  Labor and capital are the inputs used to produce goods and services. [🔉](https://youtu.be/ftmvsahQ6Wo?t=228)

###  Short Run vs. Long Run: Fixed and Variable Inputs [🔉](https://youtu.be/ftmvsahQ6Wo?t=1978)

* **Variable Inputs:** Can be easily changed (e.g., hours of work). [🔉](https://youtu.be/ftmvsahQ6Wo?t=303)
* **Fixed Inputs:** Difficult to change quickly (e.g., size of a plant). [🔉](https://youtu.be/ftmvsahQ6Wo?t=334)
* **Short Run:** Some inputs are fixed, others are variable. [🔉](https://youtu.be/ftmvsahQ6Wo?t=353)
    * **Assumption:** Labor is variable, capital is fixed. [🔉](https://youtu.be/ftmvsahQ6Wo?t=358)
* **Long Run:** All inputs are variable. [🔉](https://youtu.be/ftmvsahQ6Wo?t=409)

###  Short Run Production:  Marginal Product of Labor [🔉](https://youtu.be/ftmvsahQ6Wo?t=560)

* **Short Run Production Function:** `q = f(L, K bar)` [🔉](https://youtu.be/ftmvsahQ6Wo?t=511)
    * **Firm's Decision:** Determining the optimal amount of labor to employ, given a fixed amount of capital. [🔉](https://youtu.be/ftmvsahQ6Wo?t=718)
* **Marginal Product of Labor (MPL):** Change in output from an additional unit of labor input. [🔉](https://youtu.be/ftmvsahQ6Wo?t=580)
    * **Analogous to Marginal Utility:** Measures the additional benefit of an extra unit of input.
* **Diminishing Marginal Product:**  Each additional worker adds less to output than the previous worker, due to fixed capital.
    * **Intuition:** Limited capital means workers become less productive as more workers are added.

### Long Run Production: Isoquants [🔉](https://youtu.be/ftmvsahQ6Wo?t=1119)

* **Long Run Production Function:** Firm can choose both labor and capital. [🔉](https://youtu.be/ftmvsahQ6Wo?t=1009)
* **Isoquants:** Combinations of capital and labor that produce the same amount of output. [🔉](https://youtu.be/ftmvsahQ6Wo?t=845)
    * **Analogous to Indifference Curves:** Represent different combinations of inputs with equal levels of output. [🔉](https://youtu.be/ftmvsahQ6Wo?t=853)

    ![Slide 1](/jott/econ/lec5/slide_1.png#center)

* **Isoquant Properties:**
    * **More is Better:**  Higher isoquants represent greater output. [🔉](https://youtu.be/ftmvsahQ6Wo?t=887)
    * **No Crossing:** Isoquants cannot intersect. [🔉](https://youtu.be/ftmvsahQ6Wo?t=881)
    * **Downward Sloping:**  Decreasing one input requires increasing the other to maintain the same output. [🔉](https://youtu.be/ftmvsahQ6Wo?t=1584)

###  Extreme Cases of Input Substitutability [🔉](https://youtu.be/ftmvsahQ6Wo?t=912)

* **Perfectly Substitutable Inputs:** Production function: `q = L + K` [🔉](https://youtu.be/ftmvsahQ6Wo?t=917)
    ![Slide 1](/jott/econ/lec5/slide_2.png#center)
    * **Linear Isoquants:**  Inputs can be easily replaced without affecting output. [🔉](https://youtu.be/ftmvsahQ6Wo?t=294)
* **Perfectly Non-Substitutable Inputs:** Production function: `q = min(L, K)` (Leontief production function) [🔉](https://youtu.be/ftmvsahQ6Wo?t=172)
    ![Slide 1](/jott/econ/lec5/slide_3.png#center)
    * **Right-Angled Isoquants:**  Must have at least one unit of each input to increase output. [🔉](https://youtu.be/ftmvsahQ6Wo?t=1570)
    * **Examples:** Shoes (left and right), computer programmer and computer. [🔉](https://youtu.be/ftmvsahQ6Wo?t=1028)


###  Marginal Rate of Technical Substitution (MRTS) [🔉](https://youtu.be/ftmvsahQ6Wo?t=1316)

![Slide 4](/jott/econ/lec5/slide_4.png#center)
* **Definition:**  The slope of the isoquant, representing the rate at which one input can be substituted for another while maintaining the same output level.
    * **Formula:**  `MRTS = ΔK / ΔL`
* **Varying MRTS:** The MRTS changes along the isoquant, reflecting the changing trade-off between inputs. [🔉](https://youtu.be/ftmvsahQ6Wo?t=1584)

**Points to Ponder:**

* How do the concepts of marginal product and diminishing marginal product relate to real-world production processes? [🔉](https://youtu.be/ftmvsahQ6Wo?t=1982)
* What are some examples of industries where inputs are highly substitutable, and industries where they are not? [🔉](https://youtu.be/ftmvsahQ6Wo?t=1746)
* How do changes in technology affect the shape of production functions and the relationship between inputs and outputs? [🔉](https://youtu.be/ftmvsahQ6Wo?t=180)

**Key Takeaways:**

* Production theory focuses on how firms maximize profits by choosing efficient production levels. [🔉](https://youtu.be/ftmvsahQ6Wo?t=97)
* Production functions describe the technological relationship between inputs (labor and capital) and outputs. [🔉](https://youtu.be/ftmvsahQ6Wo?t=180)
* The short run and long run are defined by the variability of inputs, with labor typically being variable in the short run and capital fixed.
* The diminishing marginal product of labor arises from fixed capital, leading to decreasing output increases as more workers are added. [🔉](https://youtu.be/ftmvsahQ6Wo?t=580)
* Isoquants represent combinations of inputs that produce the same level of output and demonstrate the trade-off between labor and capital.
* The MRTS captures the rate at which one input can be substituted for another, and its value changes along the isoquant. 


## Production Theory: Returns to Scale & Productivity [🔉](https://youtu.be/ftmvsahQ6Wo?t=1553)

### Summary

This section explores the concept of returns to scale, analyzing how output changes when all inputs are proportionally increased. It discusses the implications of increasing, decreasing, and constant returns to scale.  The lecture concludes with a discussion on productivity, highlighting its importance in driving economic growth and the standard of living. 

### Returns to Scale

* **Definition**: Returns to scale analyze how output changes when all inputs are proportionally increased. It is not about changes in individual inputs (like K vs. L), but rather the overall scaling of the operation. 
* **Types**:
    * **Constant Returns to Scale (CRS):** Doubling inputs leads to double the output. [🔉](https://youtu.be/ftmvsahQ6Wo?t=1570)

    * **Increasing Returns to Scale (IRS):** Doubling inputs leads to more than double the output. [🔉](https://youtu.be/ftmvsahQ6Wo?t=1584)
    * **Decreasing Returns to Scale (DRS):** Doubling inputs leads to less than double the output. [🔉](https://youtu.be/ftmvsahQ6Wo?t=1584)

**Example:**

* **IRS:** A firm with two workers and two computers doubles its inputs to four workers and four computers.  If the workers are able to specialize their tasks, they become more efficient, leading to more than double the output. 

* **DRS:** As a firm grows larger, coordination becomes more difficult. Workers may slack off, leading to less than double the output despite doubled inputs.  [🔉](https://youtu.be/ftmvsahQ6Wo?t=1584)

**Note:**

> "There can never be forever increasing returns to scale."  [🔉](https://youtu.be/ftmvsahQ6Wo?t=1564)

* **Real-world examples:**
    * **DRS:** Tobacco production. The fixed land area limits the potential for output to increase proportionally with input increases. 
    ![Slide 6](/jott/econ/lec5/slide_5.png#center)

    * **IRS:** Primary metal production. With more machines and workers, production can be more efficient and lead to IRS. [🔉](https://youtu.be/ftmvsahQ6Wo?t=1786)
![Slide 6](/jott/econ/lec5/slide_6.png#center)

* **Explanation for IRS limitation:**
    *  If a firm had forever IRS, it would eventually own the entire economy.  [🔉](https://youtu.be/ftmvsahQ6Wo?t=1821)
    *  This may be happening with large tech companies like Google and Amazon. However, we think that eventually, returns to scale must decrease due to the difficulty of managing very large operations.  [🔉](https://youtu.be/ftmvsahQ6Wo?t=1856)

### Productivity

* **Definition:** Productivity is the ability to produce more output with the same amount of inputs. It is a key driver of economic growth and the standard of living.
* **Importance:**
    * Productivity determines a country's standard of living.  [🔉](https://youtu.be/ftmvsahQ6Wo?t=2072)
    *  To improve our standard of living, we need to produce more goods and services.   [🔉](https://youtu.be/ftmvsahQ6Wo?t=2352)
    * This can happen through: [🔉](https://youtu.be/ftmvsahQ6Wo?t=1497)
        * Increasing capital (K). 
        *  Improving productivity (A).

* **Historical Example of Productivity:** [🔉](https://youtu.be/ftmvsahQ6Wo?t=2435)

    * **Malthus's Prediction:**  In 1798, Thomas Malthus predicted that population growth would outpace food production, leading to cycles of mass starvation. He argued that land (a fixed input) would limit the ability to increase food production. 

    * **Why Malthus was wrong:**  Malthus did not account for technological innovation, which has significantly increased agricultural productivity. [🔉](https://youtu.be/ftmvsahQ6Wo?t=2067)
        *  Tractors, fertilizer, and genetically-modified crops have allowed for greater food production with less land and labor.
        *  Food consumption per capita has increased by 40% since 1950.  [🔉](https://youtu.be/ftmvsahQ6Wo?t=2160)

* **Beyond Agriculture:**

    *  Productivity improvements are not limited to agriculture and are prevalent in many sectors. 
    * **Henry Ford's Mass Production:**  Henry Ford revolutionized car production by introducing mass production techniques. This led to significant increases in efficiency, lower prices, and greater output.
    * **Continued Innovation:**  Innovation continues to drive productivity growth in the automotive industry.  Examples include:
        *  Tata's Nano car, which is produced for $2,500 using light materials and minimizing parts.
        *  Hybrid and electric cars. [🔉](https://youtu.be/ftmvsahQ6Wo?t=1464)

**Key Takeaway:**

> "Productivity innovation is fundamentally what determines the standard of living in a country."  [🔉](https://youtu.be/ftmvsahQ6Wo?t=2338)

*  To improve our standard of living, we need to increase our productivity by investing in new technologies, improving efficiency, and developing new methods of production. 


##  Productivity and its Impact on Standard of Living [🔉](https://youtu.be/ftmvsahQ6Wo?t=2072)

**Summary:** This section explores the relationship between productivity, standard of living, and income distribution. It examines historical trends in productivity growth in the US and raises key questions about the impact of the IT revolution on productivity, the allocation of productivity gains, and the distribution of those gains across different income groups.

**Key Points:**

* **Productivity is crucial for improving our standard of living.**  This means producing more goods and services for the same amount of work or, conversely, being able to work less for the same output.
* **Capital and innovation are key drivers of productivity.** Capital accumulation comes from savings, while innovation is crucial for increasing productivity by finding new ways to produce more efficiently.
* **Productivity growth in the US has fluctuated significantly over time.**  [🔉](https://youtu.be/ftmvsahQ6Wo?t=2072)
    * **1947-1973:** Rapid growth (2.5% per year) led to significant improvements in standard of living.
    * **1973-Early 1990s:** Slowdown to 1% per year. [🔉](https://youtu.be/ftmvsahQ6Wo?t=2491)
    * **Mid-1990s-Mid-2000s:**  Productivity growth rebounded to 2.5% due to the IT boom.
    * **Since 2005:**  Growth has slowed to 1.5% per year.
* **The impact of the IT revolution on productivity remains unclear.** Despite expectations of a major transformation, the long-term impact appears limited, raising questions about why technological advancements did not lead to sustained productivity gains.
* **There is a choice in how to spend productivity gains.** We can choose to increase consumption (more goods and services) or increase leisure time. The US has historically favored the former, while Europe has chosen to prioritize leisure.
* **The distribution of productivity gains is unequal.**  From 1947 to 1973, the benefits of productivity growth were shared broadly across society. However, since 1973, most of the gains have gone to the top 20% of income earners, while the bottom 80% have seen little improvement in their standard of living. 
* **This unequal distribution of gains raises concerns about equity and fairness.** The speaker emphasizes the importance of considering the distribution of wealth and income when crafting economic policies.

**Key Quotes:**

**Points to Ponder:**

* What are the implications of stagnant or slowing productivity growth? [🔉](https://youtu.be/ftmvsahQ6Wo?t=2716)
* How can we ensure that the benefits of productivity gains are shared more equitably across society?
* What are the long-term consequences of choosing to prioritize consumption over leisure? 

**Key Takeaways:**

* Productivity is essential for improving our standard of living, but its gains can be distributed unevenly. [🔉](https://youtu.be/ftmvsahQ6Wo?t=2386)
* We need to understand the factors driving productivity growth and address the challenges of ensuring equitable distribution.  [🔉](https://youtu.be/ftmvsahQ6Wo?t=2198)
* This requires thoughtful consideration of economic policies and how they impact the distribution of wealth and income.
