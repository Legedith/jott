**Introduction:**

This lecture revisits the concept of consumer choice, focusing on deriving the demand curve and exploring the elasticity of demand. The lecture delves into how changes in income and price affect demand.

**1. Deriving the Demand Curve** [🔉](https://youtu.be/x0scPosOsoI?t=435)

* **Key Idea:**  The demand curve represents the relationship between price and quantity demanded. This lecture aims to show how this relationship can be derived using the tools of consumer choice theory. [🔉](https://youtu.be/x0scPosOsoI?t=78)

* **Example:** A utility function *u* = *p* *c* (pizza *p* and cookies *c*) is used to illustrate this concept. The individual has an income of $72, with pizza costing $12 and cookies costing $6.

* **Graphical Analysis:**

   * **Figure 41:** This figure depicts the indifference curve analysis and budget constraints.  [🔉](https://youtu.be/x0scPosOsoI?t=143)
   * **BC1:** The initial budget constraint allows the individual to buy up to 12 cookies or 6 pizzas.  [🔉](https://youtu.be/x0scPosOsoI?t=1953)
   * **Point A:** The individual chooses 6 cookies and 3 pizzas, representing the highest achievable utility at this price.
![Slide 1](/jott/econ/lec4/slide_1.png#center)
   * **Price Change of Cookies:** [🔉](https://youtu.be/x0scPosOsoI?t=2171)
      * When the price of cookies increases to $9 (**BC2**), the budget constraint steepens, and the individual chooses 4 cookies and 3 pizzas (**Point B**). [🔉](https://youtu.be/x0scPosOsoI?t=479)
      * When the price of cookies decreases to $4 (**BC3**), the budget constraint flattens, and the individual chooses 9 cookies and 3 pizzas (**Point C**). [🔉](https://youtu.be/x0scPosOsoI?t=479)

* **Demand Curve:**

   * By plotting the points A, B, and C on a separate graph, with the price of cookies on the vertical axis and the quantity of cookies on the horizontal axis, we get the **demand curve**. 
   * The demand curve shows the negative relationship between price and quantity demanded – as the price of cookies increases, the quantity demanded decreases.  [🔉](https://youtu.be/x0scPosOsoI?t=78)
![Slide 2](/jott/econ/lec4/slide_2.png#center)

* **Understanding the Slope:** The demand curve slopes downward because as the price of cookies increases, the consumer wants less of the good, given their utility function and budget constraint. [🔉](https://youtu.be/x0scPosOsoI?t=608)

**2. Elasticity of Demand**

* **Key Idea:** The elasticity of demand measures how responsive the quantity demanded is to changes in price.  [🔉](https://youtu.be/x0scPosOsoI?t=668)

* **Formula:** Epsilon (ε) = (*ΔQ*/ *Q*) / (*ΔP*/ *P*). This formula calculates the percentage change in quantity demanded for a percentage change in price. [🔉](https://youtu.be/x0scPosOsoI?t=678)

* **Interpretation:**

   * **Negative Values:** Epsilon is always negative for downward-sloping demand curves because price and quantity move in opposite directions. [🔉](https://youtu.be/x0scPosOsoI?t=690)
   * **Magnitude:** The larger the absolute value of epsilon, the more elastic the demand. [🔉](https://youtu.be/x0scPosOsoI?t=1290)

* **Extremes:**

   * **Perfectly Inelastic Demand (ε = 0):**  In this case, the quantity demanded does not change regardless of price changes. Examples include essential goods like insulin or water, where there are no substitutes.
   * **Perfectly Elastic Demand (ε = -∞):** In this case, any price increase results in a complete loss of demand, and any price decrease leads to unlimited demand. Examples include goods with perfect substitutes, such as different brands of gum or fast food.

* **Visual Representation:**

   * **Figure 4.3:**  A perfectly elastic demand curve is horizontal, indicating that price does not change, while a perfectly inelastic demand curve is vertical, meaning the quantity demanded remains constant regardless of price. 

**3. Importance of Elasticity:**

* Understanding elasticity helps businesses determine pricing strategies and predict changes in revenue with price adjustments.
* It also provides insight into consumer behavior and market dynamics. [🔉](https://youtu.be/x0scPosOsoI?t=1771)

**4. Further Considerations:**

![Slide 3](/jott/econ/lec4/slide_3.png#center)
* The lecture acknowledges that real-world scenarios often involve more complex utility functions and demand curves. The example used in the lecture simplifies these complexities to illustrate the key principles of consumer choice theory.

**5. Key Takeaways:**

![Slide 4](/jott/econ/lec4/slide_4.png#center)
* The demand curve can be derived from a consumer's utility function and budget constraint. [🔉](https://youtu.be/x0scPosOsoI?t=88)
* The elasticity of demand measures the sensitivity of quantity demanded to price changes. [🔉](https://youtu.be/x0scPosOsoI?t=659)
* Understanding elasticity is crucial for businesses and policymakers in making informed decisions about pricing, supply, and demand.

**Points to Ponder:**

* What are some real-world examples of goods with elastic and inelastic demand? [🔉](https://youtu.be/x0scPosOsoI?t=904)
* How does the concept of elasticity apply to other economic concepts, such as income elasticity of demand or cross-price elasticity?  [🔉](https://youtu.be/x0scPosOsoI?t=643)
* How can the elasticity of demand be used to inform pricing strategies? [🔉](https://youtu.be/x0scPosOsoI?t=668)

**Facts/Trivia/Tidbits:**

* The term "elasticity" was introduced by Alfred Marshall, a prominent economist in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. 
* The concept of elasticity is widely used in various fields, including economics, marketing, and finance.

**Next Steps:**

The lecture continues to discuss how changes in income affect demand and the theoretical concepts behind analyzing price changes in economic models. 


## Consumer Choice: Income Shifts and Elasticity [🔉](https://youtu.be/x0scPosOsoI?t=1414)

### Summary

This section explores how changes in income affect demand curves and introduces the concept of the Engel curve. It also delves into the classification of goods based on income elasticity, including normal, inferior, luxury, and necessities. The lecture then transitions to analyzing the effects of price changes, decomposing them into substitution and income effects.

### Income Shifts and the Engel Curve [🔉](https://youtu.be/x0scPosOsoI?t=1177)

![Slide 5](/jott/econ/lec4/slide_5.png#center)
- **Income Changes and Demand:** When income increases, consumers generally choose to consume more of both goods. Conversely, when income decreases, they consume less of both goods. 
> "As your income goes up, you will choose more of both. As your income goes down, you will choose less of both." [🔉](https://youtu.be/x0scPosOsoI?t=1246)

- **Engel Curve:** The Engel curve represents the relationship between income and the quantity demanded of a specific good. [🔉](https://youtu.be/x0scPosOsoI?t=1268)
> "The Engel curve is the relationship between income and quantity demanded." [🔉](https://youtu.be/x0scPosOsoI?t=1268)

- **Income Elasticity of Demand:** The slope of the Engel curve is known as the income elasticity of demand, denoted by gamma (*γ*). It measures the percentage change in quantity demanded in response to a percentage change in income.
> "Gamma, which is *delta Q* over *Q*, *Q*0, once again, if we're doing just greatly. Over *delta y* over *y*0. That's the income elasticity of demand." [🔉](https://youtu.be/x0scPosOsoI?t=1299)

- **Linear vs. Constant Elasticity Curves:** The Engel curve in the example is linear, but in general, it can be non-linear. Real-world demand curves are often approximated as locally linear, which is a simplification. 
> "We know a constant elasticity curve will not be linear. Okay? If it's linear, it's not constant elasticity because if it's linear, the elasticity will change along the curve." [🔉](https://youtu.be/x0scPosOsoI?t=1336)

### Classifying Goods Based on Income Elasticity [🔉](https://youtu.be/x0scPosOsoI?t=1414)

- **Normal Goods:** These goods have a positive income elasticity (*γ* > 0), meaning that as income increases, the quantity demanded also increases. 
> "We call goods with a positive income elasticity, normal goods." [🔉](https://youtu.be/x0scPosOsoI?t=1417)

- **Inferior Goods:** These goods have a negative income elasticity (*γ* < 0), meaning that as income increases, the quantity demanded decreases.
> "We call those inferior goods." [🔉](https://youtu.be/x0scPosOsoI?t=1439)

- **Examples:** Fast food, potatoes (in the past). [🔉](https://youtu.be/x0scPosOsoI?t=2453)
> "Literally, richer people may probably eat less fast food than poorer people." [🔉](https://youtu.be/x0scPosOsoI?t=1507)
> "We are like, in the old days, like the four fast food, like that was the cheap, filling, city-tasting food stuff that guys sort of used to eat all the time." [🔉](https://youtu.be/x0scPosOsoI?t=1538)

- **Luxury Goods:** These goods have an income elasticity greater than one (*γ* > 1), meaning that as income increases, the quantity demanded increases proportionally more than the income change.
> "These are going to be goods where gamma is greater than one and necessities, gamma is less than one." [🔉](https://youtu.be/x0scPosOsoI?t=1572)

- **Examples:** Watches, boats, luxury brands.
![Slide 6](/jott/econ/lec4/slide_6.png#center)
> "In theory, necessities are things like food where clearly rich people spend more on food than poor people." [🔉](https://youtu.be/x0scPosOsoI?t=1605)

- **Necessities:** These goods have an income elasticity less than one (*γ* < 1), meaning that as income increases, the quantity demanded increases proportionally less than the income change.
> "The richer you get, the more of your budget you spend on it. In theory, necessities are things like food where clearly rich people spend more on food than poor people." [🔉](https://youtu.be/x0scPosOsoI?t=1605)

### Price Changes: Substitution and Income Effects [🔉](https://youtu.be/x0scPosOsoI?t=2605)

- **Decomposing Price Change Effects:** The lecture introduces the concept of decomposing the effect of a price change into two components: the substitution effect and the income effect. [🔉](https://youtu.be/x0scPosOsoI?t=2488)
> "The way we are going to do that is that we are going to decompose your response to a price change into two effects: the substitution effect and the income effect." [🔉](https://youtu.be/x0scPosOsoI?t=1752)

- **Substitution Effect:** The substitution effect is the change in the quantity demanded of a good when the price changes, holding utility constant.  [🔉](https://youtu.be/x0scPosOsoI?t=1782)
> "The substitution effect, we are going to define the substitution effect as the change in the quantity of a good when the price changes holding utility constant." [🔉](https://youtu.be/x0scPosOsoI?t=1775)
    - **Compensated Demand:** The substitution effect is also known as compensated demand because it represents the change in quantity demanded when the consumer is compensated to maintain their original utility level.
    > "We call this notion compensated demand. Compensated demand. That is, I am compensating you." [🔉](https://youtu.be/x0scPosOsoI?t=2008)
    - **Always Negative:** The substitution effect is always negative. This is because when the price of a good increases, consumers will always substitute towards cheaper alternatives, leading to a decrease in the quantity demanded of the good whose price increased.
    > "The substitution effect is always negative. We can see this in two ways." [🔉](https://youtu.be/x0scPosOsoI?t=2049)

- **Income Effect:** The income effect is the change in the quantity demanded of a good due to a change in purchasing power, which is effectively a change in income. This effect arises because the price change affects the consumer's ability to purchase goods.
> "The income effect is the change in the quantity of a good as income changes." [🔉](https://youtu.be/x0scPosOsoI?t=1806)

- **Graphical Representation:** The lecture uses a graphical representation to illustrate the substitution and income effects. The budget constraint shifts due to the price change, and an imaginary budget constraint is drawn to isolate the substitution effect.
> "We can exactly represent that by the shift from BC prime to BC 2. Because BC prime and BC 2 have the same slope. That shift is just the income effect." [🔉](https://youtu.be/x0scPosOsoI?t=2242)

### Points to Ponder

- The lecture emphasizes the importance of understanding the underlying decision calculus when analyzing price changes. [🔉](https://youtu.be/x0scPosOsoI?t=1743)
> "Now we are getting to some sort of deep theory." [🔉](https://youtu.be/x0scPosOsoI?t=1725)
- The concept of "effective income" highlights how a price change can lead to a reduction in purchasing power, even if nominal income remains constant.
> "You effectively are poor because this price went up." [🔉](https://youtu.be/x0scPosOsoI?t=2235)

### Key Takeaways

- Changes in income affect demand curves, and the Engel curve represents this relationship. [🔉](https://youtu.be/x0scPosOsoI?t=29)
- Goods can be classified based on income elasticity: normal, inferior, luxury, and necessities. [🔉](https://youtu.be/x0scPosOsoI?t=1417)
- Price changes can be decomposed into substitution and income effects, which help understand how consumers respond to price fluctuations. [🔉](https://youtu.be/x0scPosOsoI?t=1760)
- The substitution effect is always negative, while the income effect can be positive or negative depending on the good. [🔉](https://youtu.be/x0scPosOsoI?t=1760)
> "That is sort of confusing. Let me start with graphically to understand it." [🔉](https://youtu.be/x0scPosOsoI?t=1842)


## Consumer Choice: Income Effects and Inferior Goods [🔉](https://youtu.be/x0scPosOsoI?t=2426)

### Summary:

This section explores the concept of inferior goods and how they differ from normal goods when it comes to price changes. It introduces the income effect, which works against the substitution effect for inferior goods, potentially leading to unusual demand curve shapes. The section uses a steak and potatoes example to illustrate how a price increase in potatoes can lead to an increase in potato consumption due to the income effect. The lecture then explains the theoretical possibility of Giffen goods, where the income effect outweighs the substitution effect, resulting in an upward-sloping demand curve. The example of a study in China with rice consumption amongst extremely poor families provides evidence for the existence of Giffen goods.

### Introduction

- Continuing from the previous discussion about consumer choice, the lecture delves deeper into the concepts of income and substitution effects. [🔉](https://youtu.be/x0scPosOsoI?t=2488)

> *"That is sort of confusing. Let me start with graphically to understand it."* [🔉](https://youtu.be/x0scPosOsoI?t=1842)

###  Income and Substitution Effects [🔉](https://youtu.be/x0scPosOsoI?t=2824)

- **Substitution Effect:**  When the price of a good increases, consumers substitute away from that good and towards other cheaper alternatives. This always works in the opposite direction of the price change.
- **Income Effect:** When the price of a good changes, it affects the consumer's purchasing power, making them effectively richer or poorer. This effect can work in the same direction as the substitution effect (for normal goods) or in the opposite direction (for inferior goods).

### Inferior Goods

- An **inferior good** is a good where the demand decreases as income increases. This is opposite to a **normal good**, where demand increases with income.
- Example: **Steak and Potatoes** [🔉](https://youtu.be/x0scPosOsoI?t=1535)
    - Initial budget constraint: Price of steak = $5, price of potatoes = $1, income = $25. [🔉](https://youtu.be/x0scPosOsoI?t=408)
    - Consumer chooses point A, consuming 7.5 potatoes and 3.5 steaks. [🔉](https://youtu.be/x0scPosOsoI?t=2382)
    - Price of potatoes increases to $3. [🔉](https://youtu.be/x0scPosOsoI?t=2465)
    - **Substitution Effect:**  Consumer moves from point A to point B, consuming fewer potatoes (4) due to the higher price. [🔉](https://youtu.be/x0scPosOsoI?t=1775)
    - **Income Effect:**  Because potatoes are inferior, the consumer now wants more potatoes as they are effectively poorer. They move back from point B to point C, consuming 5 potatoes.
    - **Net Effect:** The consumer consumes fewer potatoes, but the substitution and income effects work in opposite directions. [🔉](https://youtu.be/x0scPosOsoI?t=2438)

> *"The income effect always goes the same way as the substitution effect. This is sort of just a purely useless theoretical exercise. It gets interesting when the income effect goes the opposite way of the substitution effect."* [🔉](https://youtu.be/x0scPosOsoI?t=2488)

- **Utility Function:** The type of utility function determines whether a good is normal or inferior. A different utility function is needed to create an inferior good. [🔉](https://youtu.be/x0scPosOsoI?t=2505)

### Giffen Goods

- **Giffen Goods:**  Goods that exhibit an upward-sloping demand curve, meaning a higher price leads to an increased demand. This is a rare occurrence, where the income effect overwhelms the substitution effect.
- **Theoretical Concept:**  Giffen goods are a theoretical concept, and finding real-world examples is challenging. [🔉](https://youtu.be/x0scPosOsoI?t=47)
- **Evidence:**  A study in China provided some evidence for the existence of Giffen goods. Very poor households that primarily consumed rice were given coupons to reduce the price of rice. 
    - **Non-superpoor households:**  Exhibited a typical downward-sloping demand curve, buying more rice with the discount. [🔉](https://youtu.be/x0scPosOsoI?t=2896)
    - **Superpoor households:**  Experienced an upward-sloping demand curve, buying less rice due to the discount. This is because the income effect outweighed the substitution effect. They used the extra money from the discount to buy other goods.
- **Corner Solution:** Giffen goods can be considered a corner solution where consumers allocate their entire budget to a single good. 

![Slide 8](/jott/econ/lec4/slide_8.png#center)
### Key Takeaways

- The income effect can work in the opposite direction of the substitution effect for inferior goods. [🔉](https://youtu.be/x0scPosOsoI?t=2478)
- Giffen goods are theoretical goods where the income effect dominates the substitution effect, leading to an upward-sloping demand curve. [🔉](https://youtu.be/x0scPosOsoI?t=2817)
- Real-world examples of Giffen goods are extremely rare.
- Understanding the interaction between income and substitution effects is crucial for analyzing consumer behavior and market dynamics.  [🔉](https://youtu.be/x0scPosOsoI?t=2324)
