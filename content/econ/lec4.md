### Introduction

This lecture continues the discussion of consumer choice by deriving the demand curve and exploring the concept of elasticity of demand. We will see how, using the tools learned so far, we can explain the downward-sloping relationship between price and quantity demanded. We will also examine how changes in income and price affect demand. 

### Deriving Demand Curves

* **Objective:** Derive the demand curve from consumer preferences and budget constraints. [🔉](https://youtu.be/x0scPosOsoI?t=1709)
* **Utility Function:** The utility function used in the example is *u = p* *c* (where *p* represents pizza and *c* represents cookies).
* **Budget Constraint:**  The consumer has an income of $72 and faces prices for pizza and cookies. [🔉](https://youtu.be/x0scPosOsoI?t=94)
![Slide 1](/jott/econ/lec4/slide_1.png#center)
* **Graphical Representation:** Figure 4.1 shows the indifference curve analysis. [🔉](https://youtu.be/x0scPosOsoI?t=2071)
    * **BC1:** The initial budget constraint allows for 12 cookies and no pizza or 6 pizzas and no cookies. [🔉](https://youtu.be/x0scPosOsoI?t=157)
    * **Point A:** The optimal consumption bundle is 6 cookies and 3 slices of pizza. [🔉](https://youtu.be/x0scPosOsoI?t=1999)
    * **Price Change (Cookies):**
        * **Higher Price ($9):** The budget constraint steepens (BC2), resulting in a new optimal point (B) with 3 pizzas and 4 cookies. [🔉](https://youtu.be/x0scPosOsoI?t=157)
        * **Lower Price ($4):** The budget constraint flattens (BC3), leading to a new optimal point (C) with 3 pizzas and 9 cookies. [🔉](https://youtu.be/x0scPosOsoI?t=1962)
* **Demand Curve:** The relationship between price and quantity demanded is shown graphically in Figure 4.1.  [🔉](https://youtu.be/x0scPosOsoI?t=72)
    * **Price of Cookies:**
        * $6: 6 cookies demanded
        * $9: 4 cookies demanded
        * $4: 9 cookies demanded
* **Key takeaway:** By adjusting the price of cookies while keeping other parameters constant, we can observe the resulting changes in the quantity demanded, thus deriving the demand curve. 

> **"The demand curve comes from the fact that as the price goes up, you want less of the good."** [🔉](https://youtu.be/x0scPosOsoI?t=509)

### The Elasticity of Demand [🔉](https://youtu.be/x0scPosOsoI?t=651)

* **Definition:** Elasticity of demand (*epsilon*) measures the percentage change in quantity demanded for a percentage change in price. [🔉](https://youtu.be/x0scPosOsoI?t=678)
* **Formula:**  *epsilon* = (*delta Q*/ *Q*) / (*delta P*/ *P*) [🔉](https://youtu.be/x0scPosOsoI?t=668)
* **Negative Value:**  Elasticity of demand is typically negative because as price increases, quantity demanded decreases. [🔉](https://youtu.be/x0scPosOsoI?t=690)
* **Extremes:**
    * **Perfectly Inelastic Demand (*epsilon* = 0):** Quantity demanded does not change regardless of price.  [🔉](https://youtu.be/x0scPosOsoI?t=910)
        * **Examples:** Life-saving medication (e.g., insulin), essential goods (e.g., water).
    * **Perfectly Elastic Demand (*epsilon* = -infinity):**  Any price increase results in a complete loss of demand.  [🔉](https://youtu.be/x0scPosOsoI?t=1064)
        * **Examples:** Goods with perfect substitutes (e.g., different brands of gum, fast food). [🔉](https://youtu.be/x0scPosOsoI?t=1033)

> **"The key element... is that with a perfectly elastic demand, you have a horizontal demand curve, and therefore, the price never changes."** [🔉](https://youtu.be/x0scPosOsoI?t=1058)

###  Factors Affecting Elasticity of Demand [🔉](https://youtu.be/x0scPosOsoI?t=651)

* **Availability of Substitutes:** Goods with many substitutes tend to have higher elasticity of demand. [🔉](https://youtu.be/x0scPosOsoI?t=32)
* **Necessity vs. Luxury:**  Essential goods (e.g., water) tend to have lower elasticity, while luxury goods (e.g., designer clothes) have higher elasticity.
* **Time Horizon:**  Demand elasticity tends to be higher in the long run, as consumers have more time to adjust to price changes.  [🔉](https://youtu.be/x0scPosOsoI?t=1704)

### Points to Ponder

* **Simplified Modeling:**  The utility function used in this example is a simplification that helps to illustrate the key concepts of demand. In reality, consumer preferences are more complex, and demand can be affected by various factors. 
* **Real-World Implications:** Understanding elasticity of demand is crucial for businesses when setting prices, as it helps to predict how changes in price will impact sales. 

### Key Takeaways

* The demand curve is derived from the consumer's utility function and budget constraint. [🔉](https://youtu.be/x0scPosOsoI?t=541)
![Slide 3](/jott/econ/lec4/slide_3.png#center)
* The elasticity of demand measures the sensitivity of quantity demanded to changes in price. [🔉](https://youtu.be/x0scPosOsoI?t=678)
* Perfectly inelastic demand indicates that the quantity demanded does not change with price. [🔉](https://youtu.be/x0scPosOsoI?t=910)
* Perfectly elastic demand indicates that any price increase results in zero demand.  [🔉](https://youtu.be/x0scPosOsoI?t=910)
* Understanding the concept of elasticity of demand is essential for analyzing consumer behavior and making informed business decisions.

## The Impact of Income Shifts on Demand Curves [🔉](https://youtu.be/x0scPosOsoI?t=1177)

### Summary: 

This section examines how changes in income affect consumer demand curves, introducing the concept of Engel curves and income elasticity of demand.  We explore the distinction between normal goods, inferior goods, and the categories of luxuries and necessities based on the income elasticity of demand. 

### Income Shifts and the Engel Curve [🔉](https://youtu.be/x0scPosOsoI?t=1177)

* **Shifting Income:** When income changes, consumers adjust their consumption patterns.  [🔉](https://youtu.be/x0scPosOsoI?t=2622)
    * **Increase in Income:**  Leads to increased consumption of both goods. [🔉](https://youtu.be/x0scPosOsoI?t=2706)
    * **Decrease in Income:** Leads to decreased consumption of both goods. [🔉](https://youtu.be/x0scPosOsoI?t=2457)

* **Engel Curve:** The Engel curve graphically represents the relationship between income and the quantity demanded of a good. [🔉](https://youtu.be/x0scPosOsoI?t=1268)
    * **Slope of Engel Curve:** The slope of the Engel curve represents the **income elasticity of demand** (*gamma*). [🔉](https://youtu.be/x0scPosOsoI?t=1290)

    *  > "The Engel curve is the relationship between income and quantity demanded." [🔉](https://youtu.be/x0scPosOsoI?t=1268)

* **Income Elasticity of Demand (Gamma):**  [🔉](https://youtu.be/x0scPosOsoI?t=651)
    *  *Gamma* =  (*delta Q*/ *Q* zero) / (*delta y*/ *y* zero)   [🔉](https://youtu.be/x0scPosOsoI?t=724)
    * Measures the responsiveness of quantity demanded to changes in income.  [🔉](https://youtu.be/x0scPosOsoI?t=678)
    * **Positive Gamma:**  Indicates a **normal good**, meaning consumers purchase more of the good as their income rises.
    * **Negative Gamma:** Indicates an **inferior good**, meaning consumers purchase less of the good as their income rises. 

![Slide 5](/jott/econ/lec4/slide_5.png#center)
### Linear Engel Curves and Constant Elasticity Curves [🔉](https://youtu.be/x0scPosOsoI?t=1327)

* **Technical Note:**  Linear Engel curves are not constant elasticity curves because the elasticity changes along the curve. [🔉](https://youtu.be/x0scPosOsoI?t=1336)
    * > "We are going to draw linear constant elasticity curves. Which is, of course, technically wrong. Just think of them as blown-up versions of a large demand curve. Everything is locally linear. Right? Once you get for an *epsilon* change, everything is linear. So, the truth is, we are achieving a little bit and often draw linear constant elasticity curves. I want to own that that is a cheat. Okay? But just, if everything is really local, it is not that bad a cheat. Okay?"

### Normal Goods vs. Inferior Goods [🔉](https://youtu.be/x0scPosOsoI?t=1439)

* **Normal Goods:**  Goods that consumers purchase more of when their income increases.
    * Examples:  Most consumer goods, luxury items (e.g., watches, boats, refrigerators). [🔉](https://youtu.be/x0scPosOsoI?t=1595)
* **Inferior Goods:** Goods that consumers purchase less of when their income increases. [🔉](https://youtu.be/x0scPosOsoI?t=552)
    * Examples:  Fast food, potatoes (in some cases), certain low-quality products.
    * > "Literally, richer people may probably eat less fast food than poorer people."  [🔉](https://youtu.be/x0scPosOsoI?t=1507)

###  Luxury Goods vs. Necessities  [🔉](https://youtu.be/x0scPosOsoI?t=1563)

* **Luxury Goods:** Goods that consumers spend a larger proportion of their budget on as their income increases. [🔉](https://youtu.be/x0scPosOsoI?t=1590)
    * *Gamma* > 1.
    * Examples:  Luxury watches, boats, high-end electronics. [🔉](https://youtu.be/x0scPosOsoI?t=1501)
* **Necessities:** Goods that consumers spend a smaller proportion of their budget on as their income increases.  [🔉](https://youtu.be/x0scPosOsoI?t=1613)
    * *Gamma* < 1.
    * Examples: Food, basic clothing. [🔉](https://youtu.be/x0scPosOsoI?t=1449)

![Slide 6](/jott/econ/lec4/slide_6.png#center)
    > "In theory, necessities are things like food where clearly rich people spend more on food than poor people. But they spend a smaller share of their budget on food than poor people."  [🔉](https://youtu.be/x0scPosOsoI?t=1605)

##  The Effects of Price Changes: Substitution and Income Effects [🔉](https://youtu.be/x0scPosOsoI?t=2605)

### Summary:

This section introduces the concepts of the substitution effect and the income effect, which together explain how consumers respond to price changes.  We see how these effects influence a consumer's choice of goods when the price of one good increases. 

### Decomposing the Response to Price Changes [🔉](https://youtu.be/x0scPosOsoI?t=1723)

* **Substitution Effect:** The change in quantity demanded of a good due to a price change, *holding utility constant*. [🔉](https://youtu.be/x0scPosOsoI?t=1782)
    * **Compensated Demand:**  The demand for a good when a price change is offset by an income adjustment that keeps utility constant. [🔉](https://youtu.be/x0scPosOsoI?t=1782)
    * > "The substitution effect, we're going to define the substitution effect as the change in the quantity of a good when the price changes, holding utility constant." [🔉](https://youtu.be/x0scPosOsoI?t=1775)
* **Income Effect:** The change in quantity demanded of a good due to a change in real income caused by the price change. [🔉](https://youtu.be/x0scPosOsoI?t=1806)
    * > "The income effect is the change in quantity of a good as income changes." [🔉](https://youtu.be/x0scPosOsoI?t=1806)

### Graphical Illustration of Substitution and Income Effects  [🔉](https://youtu.be/x0scPosOsoI?t=2252)

* **Example:** The price of cookies rises from $6 to $9. [🔉](https://youtu.be/x0scPosOsoI?t=186)
* **Substitution Effect:** 
    * Represented by a shift from point A (initial choice) to point B on the same indifference curve. [🔉](https://youtu.be/x0scPosOsoI?t=1929)
    * A new imaginary budget constraint (BC prime) is drawn with the same slope as the new budget constraint (reflecting the higher price of cookies). [🔉](https://youtu.be/x0scPosOsoI?t=1953)
![Slide 7](/jott/econ/lec4/slide_7.png#center)
    * The substitution effect always leads to a decrease in the quantity demanded of the good whose price has increased. [🔉](https://youtu.be/x0scPosOsoI?t=1775)
    * > "The substitution effect moves you from point A to point B. That is holding utility constant. But at these new prices, you would choose to have fewer cookies and less pizza." [🔉](https://youtu.be/x0scPosOsoI?t=1999)

* **Income Effect:** 
    * Represented by a shift from point B to point C. [🔉](https://youtu.be/x0scPosOsoI?t=2417)
    * The new budget constraint (BC2) reflects the lower real income caused by the higher price of cookies. [🔉](https://youtu.be/x0scPosOsoI?t=2272)
    * The direction of the income effect depends on whether the good is normal or inferior. [🔉](https://youtu.be/x0scPosOsoI?t=1760)

    * > "The income effect says, hold the income effect is saying, "Look, the price changed. So therefore, I shifted my consumption towards away from cookies. But the other thing that happened is I got poor." [🔉](https://youtu.be/x0scPosOsoI?t=2199)

* **Total Effect:** The combined effect of the substitution and income effects results in a decrease in the quantity demanded of cookies from six to four.  [🔉](https://youtu.be/x0scPosOsoI?t=2419)
    * > "So we got from A to C just like I told you before. But we actually get there in two steps. One step is sort of the" [🔉](https://youtu.be/x0scPosOsoI?t=2279)



## The Impact of Income Shifts on Demand Curves [🔉](https://youtu.be/x0scPosOsoI?t=1177)

### Introduction
This section delves into the complex interaction between the **substitution effect** and the **income effect** on demand curves, particularly in situations involving **inferior goods**. It highlights how these effects can work in opposite directions, leading to non-traditional demand curve behavior.

### Price and Income Effects in Action [🔉](https://youtu.be/x0scPosOsoI?t=2588)
- The **substitution effect** measures the change in demand for a good due to a change in its relative price, encouraging consumers to substitute towards relatively cheaper alternatives. 
- The **income effect** captures the change in demand resulting from a change in purchasing power due to price fluctuations.  [🔉](https://youtu.be/x0scPosOsoI?t=1806)
- In the case of **normal goods**, both effects typically work in the same direction (e.g., higher price, lower demand). [🔉](https://youtu.be/x0scPosOsoI?t=240)
- However, **inferior goods** present a different scenario. When the price of an inferior good rises, the substitution effect encourages a decrease in consumption, but the income effect can lead to an increase in demand. This occurs because a higher price effectively makes the consumer "poorer," and inferior goods are typically consumed more when income is lower.
- The **Giffen good** is a theoretical example where the income effect completely dominates the substitution effect, resulting in an **upward-sloping demand curve**. This is a rare phenomenon in real-world scenarios.

### Example: Steak and Potatoes [🔉](https://youtu.be/x0scPosOsoI?t=1535)
- The speaker presents an example of choosing between steak and potatoes. [🔉](https://youtu.be/x0scPosOsoI?t=2340)
- The **initial budget constraint** (BC1) reflects a $5 price for steak and a $1 price for potatoes, with an income of $25. The optimal consumption choice is point A: 7.5 potatoes and 3.5 steaks.
- A price increase for potatoes to $3 shifts the budget constraint and leads to two effects: [🔉](https://youtu.be/x0scPosOsoI?t=245)
    - **Substitution effect:**  Moves from point A to point B, reducing potato consumption to 4 due to the higher relative price. [🔉](https://youtu.be/x0scPosOsoI?t=1775)
    - **Income effect:** Shifts from point B to point C, increasing potato consumption back to 5.  This happens because potatoes are an inferior good, and the price increase makes the consumer effectively poorer, leading to increased consumption of the inferior good.

### Giffen Good: A Counterintuitive Concept
- The speaker emphasizes the rarity of Giffen goods, highlighting that real-world examples are difficult to find.
- An experiment in China involving rice consumption by very poor households provided some evidence supporting the existence of Giffen goods.
- In this experiment, the price of rice was lowered using coupons.  While most households responded with increased rice consumption (consistent with a downward-sloping demand curve), the extremely poor families actually reduced their rice consumption. This occurred because rice was their primary food source, and the cheaper price essentially increased their effective income, allowing them to diversify their diets and buy other goods.

### Key Takeaways
- The relationship between price changes and demand is not always straightforward, especially when dealing with inferior goods. [🔉](https://youtu.be/x0scPosOsoI?t=78)
- The interplay of substitution and income effects can produce complex outcomes. [🔉](https://youtu.be/x0scPosOsoI?t=1760)
- While Giffen goods are theoretical, real-world examples can occur in specific situations, particularly with goods that constitute a significant portion of a consumer's budget and are deemed inferior.
- Understanding the distinction between normal and inferior goods is crucial for analyzing and understanding consumer behavior in different market scenarios.
