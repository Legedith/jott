# John Stuart Mill's Utilitarianism: Detailed Notes [🔉](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=He_2GvRG40s?t=38)

[slide 1]
**Introduction:** This document provides detailed notes on John Stuart Mill's Utilitarianism, covering its core principles, distinctions from Bentham's approach, and key arguments.  We will explore hedonism, the greatest happiness principle, the qualitative aspect of pleasure, and the shift from egoism to altruism within Mill's framework.

## I.  Foundations of Mill's Utilitarianism [🔉](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=He_2GvRG40s?t=38)

**Summary:** This section lays the groundwork for understanding Mill's Utilitarianism, defining key terms like utility, hedonism, and the relationship between pleasure and happiness.  It also establishes the core principle guiding moral actions.

* **Utility:** Mill defines utility as "the property in any object that tends to produce benefit, pleasure, good, or happiness."  It's a feature of an object linked to producing positive outcomes.  Mill uses *pleasure* and *happiness* synonymously, though this isn't universally accepted.

* **Hedonism:**  This is central to Mill's theory. It posits that pleasure is the ultimate standard of morality.  Actions are judged right or wrong based on whether they increase or decrease pleasure. Pleasure is considered the highest good.  Mill distinguishes between:
    * **Psychological Hedonism:**  Pleasure is the natural object of desire; humans inherently seek pleasure and avoid pain. This is a factual claim. [🔉](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=He_2GvRG40s?t=297)
    * **Ethical Hedonism:** Pleasure is the object of desire we *ought* to seek. This is a normative claim about how we *should* act. [🔉](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=He_2GvRG40s?t=297)

* **The Greatest Happiness Principle:**  This is the cornerstone of Mill's Utilitarianism:  > "Actions are right in proportion as they tend to promote happiness, wrong as they tend to produce the reverse of happiness."  All things are desired either for inherent pleasure or as a means to avoid pain. Happiness itself is intrinsically good; other things (virtue, health, etc.) are valuable only as means to happiness.

Mill's view is rooted in psychological hedonism; he believes desiring something and finding it pleasurable are essentially the same. He advocates for ethical hedonism, building upon the psychological foundation.  His reasoning is that, just as visibility is linked to seeing and audibility to hearing, the desirability of pleasure is linked to the universal human desire for it.

## II. Qualitative Utilitarianism: Beyond Quantity [🔉](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=He_2GvRG40s?t=28)

**Summary:** This section differentiates Mill's approach from Bentham's, emphasizing the crucial distinction between quantitative and qualitative aspects of pleasure.  The concept of a "competent judge" is introduced for evaluating pleasure's quality.


* **Qualitative vs. Quantitative Pleasure:**  While both Bentham and Mill focused on "the greatest happiness for the greatest number," they differed on the *nature* of happiness.  Bentham considered only *quantitative* distinctions of pleasure (more vs. less), while Mill introduced *qualitative* distinctions. Mill argues that some pleasures are inherently more desirable and valuable than others, irrespective of quantity. This is a crucial difference, making Mill's Utilitarianism a more nuanced system.

* **The Competent Judge:** To determine which pleasure is superior, Mill suggests consulting a "competent judge"—someone who has experienced both types of pleasure.  These judges consistently prefer intellectual pleasures (e.g., intellectual pursuits, creativity) over purely sensual or bodily pleasures.  Intellectual pleasures are superior because they're internal and more enduring, unlike the transient nature of sensual pleasures. In cases of disagreement among competent judges, the majority view prevails.

* **Sense of Dignity:** Mill highlights the "sense of dignity" inherent in human nature—reason, wisdom, and self-respect—that sets us apart from animals.  His famous quote encapsulates this: > "It is better to be a human being dissatisfied than a pig satisfied."  This underscores the qualitative superiority of intellectual over sensual pleasure.

* **Autistic Hedonism:** Mill's utilitarianism is also described as "autistic hedonism" because it focuses on *general* benefit and happiness. It's not about an individual's maximum happiness but the greatest overall happiness. He reasons inductively that people's judgments about happiness are generally correct.  The utilitarian standard is not about individual maximization but maximizing the aggregate amount of happiness.

## III. From Egoism to Altruism: The Social Dimension

**Summary:** This section explores how Mill bridges the gap between self-interest (egoism) and concern for others (altruism), showing that his utilitarianism isn't simply self-serving.

* **The Transition:**  Mill acknowledges that people often set aside their own happiness for the sake of others, exhibiting empathy and altruism.  He explains this shift from egoism to altruism as a natural progression from focusing on individual happiness to recognizing the value of general happiness.  Each person's happiness is inherently good for that person; hence, the aggregate happiness of everyone is good for the collective.

**Conclusion:** Mill's Utilitarianism, while rooted in hedonism, is a sophisticated ethical framework that considers both the quantity and quality of pleasure, emphasizing the importance of intellectual and moral development.  It offers a bridge between individual self-interest and a concern for the greater good.  The next section (not included in this transcript) would likely address potential criticisms and defenses of Mill's theory.
