* **Definition:** Satyagraha, a compound of *Satya* (truth) and *Agraha* (firm grasping/holding), signifies unwavering devotion to truth. It's the exercise of pure soul force against injustice, oppression, and exploitation.  > "God is truth, and truth is God," – Mahatma Gandhi. This highlights the central role of truth in Satyagraha.
* **Truth as the Foundation:** *Satya*, derived from "Sat" (to exist/to be), encompasses both existence and truth.  Truth is the foundation of Dharma (righteousness), leading to victory.  > "I interpret my religion as the religion of truth," – Mahatma Gandhi.  This emphasizes the religious and ethical dimensions of Satyagraha.
* **Non-Violence (Ahimsa) as the Methodology:** Satyagraha is achieved through *Ahimsa* (non-violence).  Non-violence allows for a correct understanding (*samyag drishti*) of truth, while violence obscures it. > "Tolerating injustice is worse than perpetrating it," – Mahatma Gandhi. This underscores the imperative to fight injustice, but through non-violent means.
* **Self-Sacrifice:** Satyagraha involves self-sacrifice for truth and justice. Gandhiji contrasted it with violent revolutions, deemed unsustainable and condemned by scriptures.
* **Distinction from Passive Resistance:** Satyagraha differs from passive resistance. Passive resistance often stems from hatred or jealousy, while Satyagraha is characterized by love, even towards enemies. It's about reform, not revenge.  Passive resistance targets both the person and their action, while Satyagraha opposes only the unjust act, aiming for the person's reform.
* **Courage and Perseverance:** Satyagraha is not for the weak but for the courageous, those who can endure suffering without inflicting it on others.

## The Interconnection of Ends and Means [🔉](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ppz7KzWDaiY?t=1120)

**Summary:** This section details Gandhi's perspective on the crucial role of moral means in achieving moral ends, emphasizing that impure means invalidate even the most noble goals.

* **Three Types of Moral Ends:**  Gandhi identified personal, social, and universal moral ends. The ultimate moral ideal is *servodaya* (service to all), representing the "growth of all."  The progression involves focusing on personal goals first, then social, and finally universal goals.
* **The Primacy of Moral Means:** Gandhi stressed the paramount importance of moral means in achieving any end.  Wrong means render even the best ends immoral. The justification of an action hinges entirely on the means used. > "The means must always be pure, regardless of whether the end is achieved," – Mahatma Gandhi. This emphasizes the intrinsic value of ethical conduct.
* **True Success:**  True success is defined by the purity of the means employed, not solely by the achievement of the end.  Success achieved through immoral means is ultimately a failure.  Short-term gains from immoral means ultimately prove detrimental.
* **Gandhi's Advocacy of Non-Violent Means:** Gandhi advocated non-violent means like strikes and non-cooperation, rejecting violence and war. He emphasized tolerance and understanding, even towards opponents.  Non-violent means ensure success because ultimate victory belongs to truth.
