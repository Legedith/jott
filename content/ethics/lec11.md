[slide 1]
This document provides comprehensive notes on Prescriptivism, a non-descriptive moral theory contrasting Emotivism.  The notes follow the lecture's structure, highlighting key concepts and arguments.

## Introduction: Prescriptivism vs. Emotivism [🔉](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AAXiDk7dg_g?t=50)

This lecture explores Prescriptivism, also known as *Nadeesh Badhi and Parama Shvadhi* in Hindi.  It builds upon the previous lecture on Emotivism, emphasizing that both theories classify moral judgments as non-descriptive—they don't provide factual information.  The primary proponents discussed are R.M. Hare and P. Foot, with Hare's works, *The Language of Morals* and *Freedom and Reason*, serving as core texts.

[slide 2]

**Summary:** This section details the core tenets of Prescriptivism, differentiating it from Emotivism and exploring Hare's concept of universalization. [🔉](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AAXiDk7dg_g?t=450)

* **Prescriptive Nature:** Moral judgments function as commands or imperatives.  > *"Eating meat is wrong" implies "Don't eat meat."*  The purpose is to guide human conduct, advising actions and inactions. Morality is viewed as an instructional language.

* **Difference from Emotivism:**  While both theories deem moral judgments non-descriptive, Prescriptivism doesn't equate them solely with emotional expression.  Instead, it emphasizes the guidance of decision-making and influencing behavior.  > *"The purpose of moral judgment is not to express feeling, but to guide the decision-maker and other people in relation to action."*

* **Guiding Conduct:**  Moral judgments ("right" or "wrong") directly or indirectly instruct behavior.  Saying an action is "right" implies one *should* do it; "wrong" implies one *should not*. This instructional element distinguishes moral judgments from factual statements.

[slide 3]
* **Universalization:** This principle states that moral judgments apply equally to all in similar circumstances.  > *"If I say, 'you should speak the truth,' this is a moral judgment applicable to everyone."*  Rejecting this principle in similar situations reveals logical inconsistency.

* **Moral vs. Ordinary Commands:** Hare differentiates between daily commands (e.g., "bring water") and moral commands.  Moral commands necessitate universalization; they're not subject to personal whim.  > *"Ethical decisions do not depend on individual will."*

* **Consequences over Feelings:** Hare contrasts with Emotivism, arguing that an action's appropriateness depends on its consequences, not subjective feelings.  The "goodness" of an action lies in its inherent qualities or outcomes, not emotional responses.

* **Truth and Falsity:** While Hare considers moral judgments non-descriptive, he acknowledges that determining their truth or falsity adds a descriptive element. This is parallel to Foot's view of ethics as a practical science focused on guiding conduct.

## Foot's Perspective and Multiple Functions of Moral Language [🔉](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AAXiDk7dg_g?t=1006)

**Summary:** This section expands on Foot's contribution, outlining the multifaceted nature of moral language beyond mere guidance.

* **Beyond Counseling:** Foot argues moral language has additional functions besides counseling: expressing preferences, criticizing, warning, encouraging/discouraging, praising, and attracting attention.  Meaning is context-dependent.

* **Non-Descriptive Nature:** Moral judgments don't describe facts. Criticism, praise, warnings, etc., are not factual statements; hence, moral judgments are non-descriptive. [🔉](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AAXiDk7dg_g?t=270)

## Objections and Responses to Prescriptivism [🔉](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AAXiDk7dg_g?t=1121)

**Summary:** This section addresses criticisms of Prescriptivism and Hare's counterarguments. [🔉](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AAXiDk7dg_g?t=383)

* **Limitations of Guiding Conduct:**  A primary objection is that Hare limits the purpose of moral judgment solely to guiding conduct. [🔉](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AAXiDk7dg_g?t=1129)

* **Universalism and Justification:** Another criticism highlights the potential for justifying immoral actions using universalism.  For example, a racist applying the "treating all black people cruelly" rule universally to themselves and others.

* **Self-Interest as a Counter:** Hare's response posits that no rational being would accept such a judgment, as it contradicts self-interest.  Therefore, such a decision would be rejected.


## Conclusion:  Looking Ahead

The lecture concludes with a brief overview of the next topic: *Nishkarm Karma*.


## Key Takeaways

* Universalization, a key principle, mandates equal application of moral judgments in similar circumstances. [🔉](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AAXiDk7dg_g?t=568)
* Moral judgments are non-descriptive, focusing on guiding conduct rather than merely expressing emotions. [🔉](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AAXiDk7dg_g?t=207)
* Foot expands on this, highlighting the multiple functions of moral language beyond guidance.
* Objections to the limitations of focusing solely on conduct and the potential misuse of universalism are addressed. [🔉](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AAXiDk7dg_g?t=459)
