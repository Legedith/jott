[slide 1]
**Introduction:**

This lecture explores the concept of *Nishkama Karma* – selfless action – as presented in the Bhagavad Gita.  The lecture will examine its religious, social, and philosophical implications.

**The Bhagavad Gita and the Context of Nishkama Karma:** [🔉](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fPNlKpTK1Ko?t=38)

* The Bhagavad Gita, a central text of Hinduism, forms part of the Mahabharata epic. [🔉](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fPNlKpTK1Ko?t=45)
* It presents a philosophical dialogue between Lord Krishna and Arjuna on the Kurukshetra battlefield. [🔉](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fPNlKpTK1Ko?t=108)
* Arjuna's refusal to fight prompts Krishna's teachings on dharma (duty) and the nature of action.
* Krishna argues that the battlefield is also a moral field, requiring discernment between right and wrong.
* A key element of Krishna's persuasion is the concept of *Nishkama Karma*. [🔉](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fPNlKpTK1Ko?t=734)

> *"The battlefield is also a moral field, where right and wrong must be discerned."* [🔉](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fPNlKpTK1Ko?t=227)

**Karma and its Consequences:** [🔉](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fPNlKpTK1Ko?t=270)

* Every action (karma) has a consequence or fruit.  No action is fruitless, although the timing of the enjoyment of fruits may vary. [🔉](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fPNlKpTK1Ko?t=325)
* Actions are typically performed with desire (fame, wealth, power, etc.). [🔉](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fPNlKpTK1Ko?t=1160)
* The Gita associates auspicious and inauspicious consequences with karma: good work yields good results, and bad work yields bad results. [🔉](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fPNlKpTK1Ko?t=486)
* Both auspicious and inauspicious actions bind the soul to the cycle of birth and rebirth (samsara). [🔉](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fPNlKpTK1Ko?t=471)

**Types of Karma:**

The lecture outlines three types of karma: [🔉](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fPNlKpTK1Ko?t=543)
[slide 3]

* **Karma:** Actions performed according to prescribed duties. [🔉](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fPNlKpTK1Ko?t=571)
* **Akarma:** Inaction.
* **Vikarma:** Actions against prescribed duties. [🔉](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fPNlKpTK1Ko?t=571)

A further classification based on desire is introduced: [🔉](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fPNlKpTK1Ko?t=721)

* **Karma (with desire):** Action performed with a desire for its fruit, leading to attachment and the cycle of birth and death.  This is the type of action most people engage in.
* **Nishkama Karma (without desire):** Action performed without attachment to its results, driven by a sense of duty. [🔉](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fPNlKpTK1Ko?t=571)

**Nishkama Karma: Acting Without Desire for Fruit:** [🔉](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fPNlKpTK1Ko?t=771)

[slide 4]
* *Nishkama Karma* emphasizes acting out of duty, without expectation of reward. [🔉](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fPNlKpTK1Ko?t=1130)
* Krishna advises Arjuna to focus on his duty (karma) rather than its results. [🔉](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fPNlKpTK1Ko?t=210)
* This requires choosing moral commitment over self-interest. [🔉](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fPNlKpTK1Ko?t=1314)
* However, detaching from sensual feelings is challenging for ordinary individuals. [🔉](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fPNlKpTK1Ko?t=1358)

> *"Krishna tells Arjuna that his duty lies in Karma, not its result."* [🔉](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fPNlKpTK1Ko?t=210)

**The Importance of Action:** [🔉](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fPNlKpTK1Ko?t=494)

* The Bhagavad Gita does *not* advocate inaction (akarma). [🔉](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fPNlKpTK1Ko?t=1429)
* It advocates for the renunciation of the *fruits* of karma, not the renunciation of karma itself. [🔉](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fPNlKpTK1Ko?t=1747)
* Even breathing is considered karma; no being can escape karma by refraining from action. [🔉](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fPNlKpTK1Ko?t=1474)
* Renunciation of action is only possible upon achieving salvation or self-realization. [🔉](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fPNlKpTK1Ko?t=1527)


**Self-Realization and the Control of Senses:** [🔉](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fPNlKpTK1Ko?t=1522)

* Self-realization is attained through consistent adherence to moral duty. [🔉](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fPNlKpTK1Ko?t=1527)
* As self-realization progresses, a person's senses gradually come under control. [🔉](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fPNlKpTK1Ko?t=1549)


**Key Takeaway:**

The core message of the lecture is the crucial distinction between renouncing the *fruits* of karma and renouncing *karma* itself.  *Nishkama Karma* is not inaction but rather action performed without attachment to results, driven by a sense of duty and moral commitment.  This is a complex concept requiring further exploration.


**Points to Ponder:**

* How can we practically apply the concept of *Nishkama Karma* in our daily lives?
* What are the challenges in detaching from the fruits of our actions? [🔉](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fPNlKpTK1Ko?t=366)
* How does *Nishkama Karma* relate to concepts of mindfulness and selfless service?
