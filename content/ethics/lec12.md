## Plato's Four Cardinal Virtues: The Ideal State [🔉](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xp4XbXi9y1I?t=318)

**Summary:** This section explores how Plato applied the four cardinal virtues to the structure and function of his ideal state, outlining the roles of different citizen classes and the importance of harmony between them.

* **Wisdom:**  Resides in the ruling class (administrators).  It's the intellectual capacity to understand moral reality and apply it to governance, creating beneficial policies.  > "Wisdom is used to understand moral reality and apply it to daily life." [🔉](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xp4XbXi9y1I?t=117)

* **Courage:**  The defining virtue of the warrior class.  It's the ability to confront fear rationally and remain steadfast in the face of obstacles, both internal and external to the state. > "Courage allows one to remain steadfast in the face of obstacles, but it should always be reasoned and rational."

* **Self-Control (Temperance):**  The virtue of the productive class (farmers and traders).  It's the ability to regulate desires and maintain order, ensuring harmonious cooperation within the state. > "Self-control stems from the fact that beings have many desires. Self-control protects against excess and involves self-regulation and obedience to authority, suggesting harmony among conflicting elements."

* **Justice:**  The overarching virtue of the ideal state, achieved through the harmonious interplay of wisdom, courage, and self-control.  It's the principle of everyone fulfilling their designated role without interfering with others. > "Justice is the principle that operates in the context of both the ideal state and the balanced individual; everyone should do their own work and not interfere with others."  Justice is not a single quality but a unity of virtues.  > "Justice is established when everyone fulfills their duty and does not interfere with others' work."

* **Courage:** Allows one to overcome adversity and fear. [🔉](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xp4XbXi9y1I?t=162)

* **Self-Control:** Crucial for managing desires; uncontrolled desires lead to disastrous consequences.

* **Justice:** Achieved when reason, emotion, and desire work harmoniously. A just person prioritizes wisdom, courage, and self-control over their opposites.  > "A just person chooses wisdom, courage, moderation, and justice over foolishness, cowardice, lack of self-control, and injustice."  An unjust person lacks these virtues. > "The unjust person fails to be wise, courageous, or moderate. Justice is a combination of these three virtues."
