# John Stuart Mill's Utilitarianism: Detailed Notes [🔉](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pG2cOqRfarY?t=38)

[slide 1]
## Introduction

This document provides detailed notes on John Stuart Mill's Utilitarianism, building upon the foundation laid by Jeremy Bentham.  The core focus is on Mill's modifications and refinements to the theory, highlighting the distinctions between his approach and Bentham's.  Key concepts such as hedonism (both psychological and ethical), the greatest happiness principle, and the qualitative vs. quantitative aspects of pleasure are explored.


## Hedonism and Utilitarianism: The Foundation [🔉](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pG2cOqRfarY?t=15)

**Summary:** This section lays the groundwork by defining utilitarianism and hedonism, explaining their relationship, and differentiating between psychological and ethical hedonism.

*   **Utilitarianism:** A moral philosophy asserting that the morally right action is the one that maximizes overall happiness or "good," where "good" is equated with pleasure.
*   **Jeremy Bentham's Contribution:** Bentham, the founder, emphasized the *quantitative* aspect of pleasure, focusing on the greatest happiness for the greatest number. [🔉](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pG2cOqRfarY?t=396)
*   **Mill's Modification:** Mill refined this, introducing a *qualitative* dimension to the concept of pleasure. [🔉](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pG2cOqRfarY?t=798)
*   **Hedonism:** The philosophical view that pleasure is the ultimate good. [🔉](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pG2cOqRfarY?t=208)
[slide 2]
    *   **Psychological Hedonism:**  The claim that *pleasure is the inherent object of human desire*. We naturally seek pleasure and avoid pain. This is a descriptive statement about human nature.  > "We desire that which is pleasant, and therefore we desire pleasure." [🔉](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pG2cOqRfarY?t=297)
    *   **Ethical Hedonism:** The claim that *pleasure is the object of desire that we ought to seek*.  This is a prescriptive statement about how we should act. It connects pleasure to the rightness and wrongness of actions. [🔉](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pG2cOqRfarY?t=297)

> "Psychological hedonism is based on fact; ethical hedonism is based on principle." [🔉](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pG2cOqRfarY?t=273)


## The Greatest Happiness Principle and its Implications [🔉](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pG2cOqRfarY?t=1211)

**Summary:** This section details Mill's Greatest Happiness Principle and explores how it connects pleasure with desirability.  It also reveals the transition from egoism to altruism within the framework.

*   **The Greatest Happiness Principle:**  > "Actions are right in proportion as they promote happiness and wrong as they produce the reverse."  Happiness is defined as pleasure and the absence of pain. [🔉](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pG2cOqRfarY?t=406)
*   **Intrinsic vs. Instrumental Goods:** All desirable things are desirable either for their inherent happiness (pleasure) or as a means of preventing pain. Happiness is considered an *intrinsic good*, while other things like virtue are *instrumental goods*—meaning they are valuable because they lead to happiness.
*   **Mill's Psychological Hedonism:** Mill believes that what we find desirable is what we find pleasurable.  This is the basis for his ethical hedonism. [🔉](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pG2cOqRfarY?t=273)
*   **From Egoism to Altruism:** Mill's utilitarianism argues for general happiness, not just individual happiness.  The transition is made through an inductive argument: if A's happiness is good for A, and B's happiness is good for B, then general happiness is good for all.  This is the movement from egoistic concern for one's own happiness to an altruistic concern for the general happiness.

## Qualitative vs. Quantitative Utilitarianism: Mill's Refinement [🔉](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pG2cOqRfarY?t=28)

**Summary:**  This section contrasts Bentham's and Mill's approaches to utilitarianism, highlighting the critical distinction between quantitative and qualitative assessments of pleasure.

*   **Bentham's Gross Utilitarianism:**  Bentham focused primarily on the *quantity* of pleasure, aiming for the greatest amount of pleasure for the greatest number of people.  This is a purely quantitative approach.
*   **Mill's Refined Utilitarianism:** Mill introduced a *qualitative* element, arguing that some pleasures are more desirable and valuable than others.  This is the key difference. [🔉](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pG2cOqRfarY?t=770)
*   **Competent Judges:** Mill proposes appealing to "competent judges"—those who have experienced both higher and lower pleasures—to determine which pleasures are superior.  > "If there is a conflict, the majority opinion should prevail."  Intellectual pleasures (internal satisfaction) are valued over sensual pleasures (external stimulation).
*   **The Dignity of Humanity:**  Mill emphasizes the importance of human dignity, stating: > "It is better to be a human being dissatisfied than a pig satisfied."  This highlights the qualitative superiority of intellectual pleasures, even if they don't always bring immediate gratification.

## Autistic Hedonism and the Utilitarian Standard [🔉](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pG2cOqRfarY?t=208)

**Summary:** This section explains Mill's concept of autistic hedonism and clarifies the utilitarian standard of right conduct. [🔉](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pG2cOqRfarY?t=208)

[slide 4]
*   **Autistic Hedonism:** This refers to Mill's focus on *general* benefit or happiness rather than individual happiness.  However, the justification for this shift is not explicitly provided in this portion of the transcript.
*   **The Utilitarian Standard:** The standard of right conduct, according to Mill, is not an agent's greatest happiness but the greatest amount of happiness altogether.  This reiterates the altruistic nature of Mill's utilitarianism.


## Key Takeaways

*   Mill's utilitarianism builds upon Bentham's but introduces a crucial qualitative distinction in the assessment of pleasure. [🔉](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pG2cOqRfarY?t=673)
*   The Greatest Happiness Principle is central to Mill's ethics, guiding actions towards maximizing overall happiness. [🔉](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pG2cOqRfarY?t=406)
*   Mill distinguishes between psychological hedonism (descriptive) and ethical hedonism (prescriptive). [🔉](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pG2cOqRfarY?t=619)
*   The concept of "competent judges" is key in determining the relative value of different pleasures.
*   Mill's utilitarianism emphasizes general happiness over individual happiness, advocating for a shift from egoism to altruism.

## Points to Ponder

*   How can we objectively determine who qualifies as a "competent judge"? [🔉](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pG2cOqRfarY?t=865)
*   What are the limitations of an inductive argument in justifying autistic hedonism?
*   Are there situations where maximizing general happiness might conflict with individual rights or justice?
