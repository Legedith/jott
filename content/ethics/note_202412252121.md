# David Hume's Problem of "Is" and "Ought" [🔉](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pf39E51wWWs?t=1159)

[slide 1]
## Introduction

This document summarizes a lecture on David Hume's problem of "is" and "ought," exploring the inherent difficulty in deriving prescriptive statements ("ought") from descriptive statements ("is").  The lecture examines the distinction between facts (descriptive statements) and values (prescriptive statements), highlighting the naturalistic fallacy and proposing several solutions to this philosophical challenge.  The core question addressed is how, or even if, we can bridge the gap between what *is* and what *ought* to be.

> "No judgment of ought can be reasonably inferred from facts alone." - David Hume (paraphrased) [🔉](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pf39E51wWWs?t=373)

## The "Is-Ought" Problem: A Core Distinction [🔉](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pf39E51wWWs?t=237)
[slide 2]

This section outlines Hume's central argument:  we cannot logically derive "ought" from "is."  A factual statement about the world (e.g., "arsenic is poisonous") does not, in itself, imply a value judgment (e.g., "we ought not ingest arsenic"). The connection requires an additional, prescriptive premise.

* **Facts ("Is"):** Descriptive statements about the world.  Examples include: "The apple is red," "The sky is blue," "This girl is beautiful." These statements describe reality.
* **Values ("Ought"):** Prescriptive statements about what should or should not be done.  Examples:  "We should help others," "We should not lie," "We ought to pursue justice."  These statements express moral or ethical judgments.

Hume argues that many philosophers mistakenly attempt to derive "ought" from "is," committing a logical fallacy. For example, the statement, "This action causes pleasure, therefore we ought to perform this action," commits this fallacy.  The connection between pleasure and the moral obligation to pursue it is not inherent in the fact that pleasure is experienced.  This is akin to G.E. Moore's concept of the **naturalistic fallacy**, which is the attempt to define moral values solely in terms of natural facts.

## Examples and Elaboration

The lecture provides several examples to illustrate the distinction between "is" and "ought":

* **Promises:** A promise creates a moral obligation ("ought"), but this obligation is not inherent in the fact that a promise was made. The "ought" is derived from a social contract, not simply the fact of the promise.
* **Arsenic:**  Knowing that arsenic is poisonous ("is") does not automatically lead to the conclusion that we should not ingest it ("ought"). A moral judgment is needed to bridge this gap.
* **Essential vs. Mandatory:** While some actions are essential for survival ("is"), this does not automatically make them morally mandatory ("ought").

## Attempts to Bridge the Gap: Proposed Solutions [🔉](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pf39E51wWWs?t=821)

The lecture explores several proposed solutions to the "is-ought" problem: [🔉](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pf39E51wWWs?t=964)

### 1. Platonic Solution: Moral Objectivism [🔉](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pf39E51wWWs?t=833)

This solution suggests that objective moral values exist independently of human perception—think of **Plato's theory of Forms**.  These ideal forms (e.g., beauty, goodness) represent what "ought" to be, and they exist alongside physical facts.  Knowledge of these forms, perhaps through reason or intuition, allows us to derive "ought" statements.

### 2. Theistic Solution

Similar to the Platonic solution, this approach posits a perfect God whose attributes embody the ideal forms.  God's commands or dictates then provide the basis for moral "oughts."  This solution grounds moral values in a divine source, providing a basis for prescriptive statements.

### 3. Aristotelian Solution: Teleology

[slide 4]
This solution utilizes the concept of **teleology**—the idea that everything has a natural purpose or goal (*telos*).  Human beings, according to this view, have a natural purpose (e.g., flourishing, eudaimonia), and achieving this purpose dictates what we "ought" to do.  This solution attempts to connect "is" (human nature) to "ought" (pursuing goals and achieving eudaimonia).  It links "ought" to human nature and the pursuit of natural ends.  While based on probability, this probability itself is still an aspect of reality.

## Key Takeaways

* Hume's problem of "is" and "ought" highlights the fundamental difference between descriptive and prescriptive statements.
* Deriving "ought" from "is" is a logical fallacy, according to Hume.
* Several philosophical solutions attempt to bridge this gap, including Platonic, theistic, and Aristotelian approaches.
* The distinction between "is" and "ought" remains a central challenge in ethics and moral philosophy.

## Points to Ponder

* How can we effectively translate our understanding of what *is* into a framework for determining what *ought* to be?
*  Are the proposed solutions to Hume's problem satisfactory, or do they themselves present inherent limitations?
*  What role does subjective experience and cultural context play in our understanding of "ought"?
