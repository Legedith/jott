[slide 1]
**Introduction:** This section introduces Mahatma Gandhi and his philosophy of non-violence (ahimsa), highlighting its significance in Indian philosophy and Gandhi's role in making it a practical philosophy.

* **Mahatma Gandhi:** Briefly introduced as a lawyer, politician, social activist, and writer, known as the "Father of the Nation" and "Mahatma" (great soul).  His autobiography, *The Story of My Experiments with Truth*, details his philosophical thoughts.  Truth and non-violence are central to his ideology.

* **Ahimsa (Non-Violence):** Defined as the absence of violence (himsa), a crucial moral value in Jain and Buddhist philosophies, and present in ancient Indian texts. Gandhi is credited with making it a practical philosophy.

**Non-Violence: Negative and Positive Interpretations:** This section explores the dual meaning of ahimsa, differentiating between the absence of harm and the presence of positive action.

* **Negative Interpretation:**  Focuses on *not causing harm*—physical or mental—through thought, word, or deed. This extends beyond physical violence to include abusive language, rude behavior, and negative thoughts.  The speaker emphasizes that thoughts precede actions, and wrong thoughts lead to wrong actions.  This definition encompasses all living creatures. Importantly, the intention behind an action is crucial; killing or injuring can be non-violent if done for the welfare of another (e.g., amputating a poisoned limb). Similarly, eliminating harmful insects isn't considered violence.  The key is to avoid harming others due to negative feelings.

* **Positive Interpretation:** This view surpasses simply avoiding harm and emphasizes *positive attitudes* towards all living beings.  Gandhi equated ahimsa with love and respect, stating that love and respect prevent harming others. This positive sense of non-violence entails caring for and fostering peace among all living beings.

* **Ahimsa vs. Cowardice:** Gandhi clarifies that ahimsa isn't cowardice but requires strength, courage, and fearlessness.  He distinguished between avoiding danger (cowardice) and facing danger with courage and moral conviction (ahimsa). Ahimsa is viewed as a moral and spiritual force.  Gandhi believed violence isn't an inherent human trait but something overcome through rationality and moral principles.


**The Importance of Non-Violence:** This section highlights the profound significance of non-violence in Gandhi's philosophy and its potential for resolving global issues.

* **Central to Gandhi's Philosophy:**  Gandhi considered non-violence the "first step of his faith and the last step of his religion,"  a law of the human race based on human dignity and spiritual strength, not physical force.  He argued the world's survival depends on love, not weaponry.

* **Potential for Resolving Conflicts:**  Gandhi believed widespread adoption of non-violence could resolve economic, religious, social, and political problems.  The application of non-violence across diverse fields is considered highly beneficial.  He didn't claim to have invented the concept but made it more comprehensive and practical.

**Conclusion:** The section concludes with a brief summary and a preview of the next topic.

* **Summary:** Gandhi's concept of non-violence (ahimsa) is explored, encompassing both negative (avoiding harm) and positive (fostering love and peace) interpretations.  It's presented as a powerful moral and spiritual force capable of addressing various global issues.
