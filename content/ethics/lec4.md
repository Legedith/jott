*Summary:* This section delves into Aristotle's search for the ultimate good, identifying pleasure and a contemplative life as essential components of true happiness, attainable only through virtuous action.
[slide 2]

*   Aristotle sought the ultimate good, something desirable in itself, not merely a means to an end.  Things like wealth and respect are not ultimate goods because they are instrumental.
*   Aristotle considered **pleasure** the ultimate good for human beings, self-sufficient and desirable in itself.
*   True happiness (eudaimonia) is achieved through an intelligent and contemplative life, possible only by acting virtuously.  > "Human beings attain true happiness or bliss only in an intelligent and contemplative life." [🔉](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqXdHyO7fnA?t=320)
*   Virtue is therefore essential for a joyful life. [🔉](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqXdHyO7fnA?t=369)

[slide 3]
*Summary:* This section defines virtue as a permanent mental state cultivated through constant practice, expressed in voluntary acts guided by intellect and free will.  Self-control is central.

*   Aristotle defines virtue as a "permanent mental state arising from constant practice and expressed in voluntary acts determined by the intellect."
*   It is developed through consistent practice, not solely innate. [🔉](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqXdHyO7fnA?t=478)
*   Virtuous actions are voluntary, free from external pressure, and guided by both emotion and intelligence. [🔉](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqXdHyO7fnA?t=642)
*   **Self-control** is crucial for regulating emotions, desires, and lusts.  > "At the root of all virtues lies self-control."  Aristotle saw virtue as a regulator of human feelings and desires.


**IV. Two Classes of Virtue: Intellectual and Moral** [🔉](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqXdHyO7fnA?t=761)
[slide 4]

*Summary:* This section explains Aristotle's classification of virtues into intellectual and moral, based on his understanding of the soul's dual nature (intellectual and emotional aspects).

*   Aristotle distinguished between **intellectual** and **moral** virtues. This is based on his view of the human soul having intellectual and emotional parts.
*   He saw no significant difference between humans and animals regarding the emotional side of the soul, as both share similar natural tendencies and desires.
*   The intellectual side distinguishes humans.  **Wisdom** is the primary intellectual virtue, encompassing knowledge of right and wrong, practical application, philosophical thinking, and scientific knowledge.  Practical intelligence guides human life and is inherent in most individuals.
*   Intellectual virtue develops through education, while moral virtue involves both emotional and intellectual elements, with intellect controlling instincts and desires.
