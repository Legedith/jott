# Cultural Relativism: Lecture Notes - Part 1 [🔉](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wkLLvz5Xgxk?t=1114)

[slide 1]
**Introduction:** This lecture introduces the concept of cultural relativism, exploring its definition, implications, and examples.  The lecture begins by defining culture and then contrasts it with the concept of universal moral principles.

## What is Culture?

A summary of the definition of culture: Culture is a system of shared beliefs, norms, and behaviors within a group or community.  These shared principles guide the evaluation of members' conduct.  While not every member adheres to every aspect, awareness of cultural norms is key.

* **Definition:** Culture encompasses socially transmitted beliefs, norms, and behaviors.  It dictates what constitutes "right" and "wrong" within a specific group. [🔉](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wkLLvz5Xgxk?t=11)
* **Examples:**
    * Hindu rituals like Amavasya Puja and Goi Puja (fasting, though not universally observed).
    * Restrictions on nail-cutting or hair-washing on certain days (again, not universally followed).
    * Social etiquette:  In South Africa, sitting next to someone on a nearly empty bus is considered polite.

> "Culture measures human conduct; actions conforming to one's culture are considered right, while non-conforming actions are considered wrong." [🔉](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wkLLvz5Xgxk?t=56)
[slide 2]

Culture is multifaceted, encompassing ethnicity, gender, customs, and values.  Each community possesses a unique cultural identity reflecting its thinking, practices, behavior, and worldview.


## What is Cultural Relativism? [🔉](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wkLLvz5Xgxk?t=421)

A summary of Cultural Relativism: Cultural relativism argues against the existence of universal moral principles. It asserts that moral values are relative to specific cultures, meaning no single culture's morality is superior to another. [🔉](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wkLLvz5Xgxk?t=519)

* **Core Argument:** There are no universally applicable moral rules. Moral values are culturally determined. [🔉](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wkLLvz5Xgxk?t=519)
* **Rejection of Absolute Values:**  Relativism rejects the idea of absolute values, truths, norms, and principles that apply universally. [🔉](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wkLLvz5Xgxk?t=371)
* **Equal Value of Cultures:** All cultures are deemed equally important and valuable; no culture is inherently better or worse than another. [🔉](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wkLLvz5Xgxk?t=428)
* **Moral Relativity:** The moral rightness or wrongness of an action is determined by the moral norms of the society in which it occurs. [🔉](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wkLLvz5Xgxk?t=460)


> "From a cultural relativism perspective, no culture is morally, legally, or politically superior to another. It is a theory positing that no culture is better or worse than others." [🔉](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wkLLvz5Xgxk?t=434)

## Examples of Cultural Differences Illustrating Relativism [🔉](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wkLLvz5Xgxk?t=839)

A summary of the examples:  Several examples highlight the vast differences in moral standards across cultures, emphasizing that what is considered acceptable or unacceptable behavior varies significantly.  These differences underscore the core tenets of cultural relativism.

* **Calitians (Indian Tribe):**  Eat the bodies of their deceased fathers as a sign of respect.  This contrasts sharply with Hindu funeral practices. [🔉](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wkLLvz5Xgxk?t=543)
* **Schema Culture:**  Polygamy is practiced, with men sometimes sharing wives with guests, and women having the freedom to leave their husbands.  Elderly, non-contributing family members may be left to die in the snow.
* **Dietary Practices:** Eating beef is acceptable in some cultures but strictly forbidden in Hinduism. [🔉](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wkLLvz5Xgxk?t=805)
* **Treatment of Rape Victims:** In some cultures, women who have been raped may be killed by their families. [🔉](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wkLLvz5Xgxk?t=849)
* **Sati System:** The practice of widows immolating themselves on their husband's funeral pyres was once considered acceptable by some Hindus but condemned by the British.


## Can We Judge Other Cultures? [🔉](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wkLLvz5Xgxk?t=1070)

A summary of the implications for judging other cultures:  The lecture concludes by emphasizing the limitations of judging other cultures from an external perspective. We lack the necessary cultural context for such judgments.

* **The Challenge of Judgment:** It's impossible to judge a culture as completely right or wrong from an outsider's perspective.
* **Avoiding Ethnocentrism:**  Labeling unfamiliar cultures as "backward" or "primitive" is ethnocentric and unfair.
* **Emphasis on Understanding:** We should focus on describing and understanding different cultural practices rather than judging their morality.
* **Contextual Morality:** Right and wrong are defined within the context of a given culture. [🔉](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wkLLvz5Xgxk?t=1108)
* **Rejection of Superiority:**  Cultural relativism rejects the notion that any culture is superior to another. [🔉](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wkLLvz5Xgxk?t=434)


> "We cannot judge a culture as completely right or wrong because we are not part of it. People often label unfamiliar cultures as backward or primitive, making quick judgments."

**Conclusion:** The lecture concludes by stating that cultural relativism highlights the diversity of cultures and values, emphasizing the equal value of all cultures.  The discussion will continue in the next lecture.  The analogy to the diversity of languages is made, reinforcing the idea of equal value and the importance of understanding, rather than judgment.
