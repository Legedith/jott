# Kantian Ethics: Duty for Duty's Sake [🔉](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82Q2BgboQBY?t=12)

[slide 1]
## Previous Summary: Goodwill and its Expression [🔉](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82Q2BgboQBY?t=102)

The previous video introduced **Kantian ethics** and the concept of **Goodwill**, which Kant considered absolute and inherent in human intellect.  Goodwill, being abstract, requires a medium for expression: **moral duty**, or **duty for duty's sake**.  This is because humans are not purely intellectual beings; unlike a hypothetical "holy will" found only in God or saints, our will is influenced by desires and emotions.

## Duty as the Expression of Goodwill [🔉](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82Q2BgboQBY?t=67)

* **The Problem:**  Why is duty necessary if we possess Goodwill? A purely intellectual being would act virtuously naturally. [🔉](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82Q2BgboQBY?t=264)
* **Kant's Solution:** Humans are not purely intellectual; our desires and tendencies hinder virtuous action.  Duty provides a framework for expressing Goodwill despite these internal obstacles.
* > "An action motivated by inclination is not moral, even if it produces good results." This highlights the difference between acting from duty (Goodwill) and acting from inclination (not moral).

## Types of Duty

Kant distinguishes between two types of duty: [🔉](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82Q2BgboQBY?t=359)

### Perfect Duty

* **Definition:**  Necessary for every human being under all circumstances, with no exceptions. Desire is irrelevant; it's a universal command.
* **Examples:**
    * **Duty to oneself:** Not committing suicide. [🔉](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82Q2BgboQBY?t=420)
    * **Duty to others:** Repaying a loan. [🔉](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82Q2BgboQBY?t=489)


### Imperfect Duty

* **Definition:** Allows for some freedom in how the duty is fulfilled.  There's no single prescribed way to act.
* **Examples:**
    * **Duty to oneself:** Developing one's physical and mental capabilities. [🔉](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82Q2BgboQBY?t=601)
    * **Duty to others:** Helping a distressed person (the extent of help is flexible).

**Key Difference:** Perfect duty has no exceptions; imperfect duty allows for choice and flexibility based on individual circumstances and abilities.

## Imperatives: Introduction

The next topic is **categorical imperatives**.  First, the speaker defines an **imperative** as a command, viewing action as a means to an end.  Examples include "pay your taxes" or "close the door".

Two types of imperatives are introduced: [🔉](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82Q2BgboQBY?t=735)

* **Hypothetical Imperatives:** Conditional on desire.  Example: "If you want to go to medical school, study biology."  The command only applies if the desire is present. [🔉](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82Q2BgboQBY?t=765)
* **Categorical Imperatives:** Independent of conditions or results.  Kant argues these are absolute and represent moral law.  These will be discussed in detail in the next video.

## Key Takeaways

* **Goodwill:** The only thing inherently good, expressed through duty. [🔉](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82Q2BgboQBY?t=119)
* **Duty:** Necessary due to the limitations of the human will.
* **Perfect Duty:** Universal and unconditional. [🔉](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82Q2BgboQBY?t=412)
* **Imperfect Duty:** Allows for flexibility and choice. [🔉](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82Q2BgboQBY?t=512)
* **Imperatives:** Commands, either conditional (hypothetical) or unconditional (categorical).  Categorical imperatives are the focus of the next video. [🔉](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82Q2BgboQBY?t=669)

## Points to Ponder

* What are the practical implications of distinguishing between perfect and imperfect duties?
* How do categorical imperatives differ from hypothetical imperatives in shaping moral action? [🔉](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82Q2BgboQBY?t=779)
