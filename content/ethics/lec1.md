# Conventional Morality vs. Reflective Morality [🔉](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvS4RdMrlF4?t=1176)

[slide 1]
## Introduction

This lecture explores the concepts of **conventional morality** (Param Paragat, Netikta) and **reflective morality** (Vyaktik Netikta), highlighting their differences and the transition between them.  The discussion begins by establishing humans as inherently social beings, whose moral development is deeply rooted in societal interactions and traditions.

> "Since we are discussing morality, we must first consider humans as social beings. In humans, the power of thought develops through gradual association with society; argument is a product of social interaction."


## Conventional Morality: The Foundation of Social Order [🔉](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvS4RdMrlF4?t=323)

**Summary:** This section defines conventional morality, its origins, mechanisms of enforcement, and both its strengths and weaknesses.  It emphasizes the role of tradition, ritual, and social pressure in shaping individual behavior.

* **Definition:** Conventional morality, also known as customary, traditional, or ritualistic morality, is a system of moral values and beliefs derived from the customs and traditions of a particular society or group.  It's a set of rules and norms passed down through generations, often enforced through social pressure and the authority of elders.

* **Origins:** The origins of conventional morality are multifaceted: [🔉](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvS4RdMrlF4?t=1033)
    * **Transactional Interactions:** Early human interactions, like gift-giving in ancient hunting groups, established relationships and eventually solidified into traditions.
    * **Success and Failure:** Actions associated with good or bad fortune shaped the development of customs; successful actions were repeated and enshrined as traditions.
    * **Habitual Behavior:**  Repetitive behaviors in specific situations evolved into established customs.

* **Custodians of Tradition:** The transmission of conventional morality is maintained by custodians like older men and women, priests, chiefs, and family heads (Prajhan), who are responsible for teaching and enforcing these customs. This transmission even involves deceased members of the group or ancestors.


* **Mechanisms of Enforcement:**  Conformity to conventional morality is rewarded with social approval, while defiance is punished.  This enforcement mechanism relies heavily on social pressure, fear of disapproval, and sometimes even physical force (though the latter is noted as an exception rather than a rule).

* **Durkheim and Mauss's factors:** Sociologists Emile Durkheim and Marcel Mauss identified key factors contributing to the development and persistence of customs:
    * Public approval and disapproval [🔉](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvS4RdMrlF4?t=802)
    * Taboos (Nishidh): prohibitions often based on fear of unseen powers [🔉](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvS4RdMrlF4?t=860)
    * Tradition itself.

* **Strengths of Conventional Morality:** [🔉](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvS4RdMrlF4?t=1044)
    * Fosters increased interaction and mutual support among group members. [🔉](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvS4RdMrlF4?t=1052)
    * Reduces self-interest.
    * Promotes social unity.

* **Weaknesses of Conventional Morality:** [🔉](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvS4RdMrlF4?t=1092)
    * Some customs may be illogical, irrational, unjust, or conflicting. [🔉](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvS4RdMrlF4?t=1107)
    * Old customs can hinder societal progress. [🔉](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvS4RdMrlF4?t=1127)
    * Lacks individual choice; actions are judged solely by their conformity to tradition.
    * Ritualistic morality is insufficient to meet all human needs and aspirations. [🔉](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvS4RdMrlF4?t=1183)


## Transition to Reflective Morality: A Necessary Evolution [🔉](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvS4RdMrlF4?t=1189)

**Summary:** This section sets the stage for the next part of the lecture, which will delve deeper into the transition from conventional to reflective morality. It highlights the limitations of adhering solely to conventional morality.

> "Conventional morality is not private morality; ritualistic morality cannot satisfy human demands indefinitely. Traditional morality does not accommodate individual choice; actions are judged according to their conformity to tradition."

The limitations of conventional morality—its rigidity, potential for injustice, and inability to account for individual circumstances—create a need for a more nuanced and adaptable ethical framework: reflective morality.  The next section will explore this transition and the factors that contribute to it.

## Key Takeaways

* Conventional morality is a system of moral values deeply embedded in societal customs and traditions. [🔉](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvS4RdMrlF4?t=323)
* It's transmitted through generations and reinforced by social pressure and authority figures.
* While it has positive aspects, its inherent limitations necessitate the emergence of reflective morality. [🔉](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvS4RdMrlF4?t=0)
* The transition to reflective morality involves a shift from blind adherence to tradition towards critical self-reflection and individual ethical reasoning.
