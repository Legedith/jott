**Example of a Video Recommendation:** [🔉](https://youtu.be/j2w_hYLzpi4?t=770)

> "Miss CEO, our team was tasked with determining the optimal price for your gasoline. Based on our analysis, I recommend pricing your gasoline at 1.7 euros per liter. This pricing strategy will maximize profits from gasoline sales. However, a potential risk is that this pricing might deter customers from purchasing other services at your gas station, such as car washes, food, and convenience items. To address this, we could explore the impact of pricing on overall profitability, considering all revenue streams within the gas station."
