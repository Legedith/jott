### Introduction

This unit delves into the nature and development of morality, focusing on the complexities of ethical judgments and the definition of ethics.  [🔉](https://youtu.be/PG3fm2f8jSI?t=1529)

###  Defining Ethics: A Normative Science of Conduct [🔉](https://youtu.be/PG3fm2f8jSI?t=1004)

* **Ethics is a science:**  It involves a systematic and comprehensive study of human conduct, aiming to understand and evaluate actions as right or wrong. 
    * > "Science is a systematic study of something. When we talk about the knowledge of the body, about the knowledge of a certain thing, particularly about an event."
    * **Science vs. Ordinary Knowledge:**  Science provides complete and objective knowledge, unlike ordinary knowledge, which can be subjective and limited.
    * **Example:**  The scientific study of pizza's health effects considers all its ingredients and their impact on the body, while personal experience might only focus on the taste.
* **Ethics is a normative science:**  It focuses on judging and evaluating human conduct based on established standards of good and bad.  [🔉](https://youtu.be/PG3fm2f8jSI?t=419)
    * **Descriptive (Positive) Science vs. Normative Science:**  Descriptive sciences simply observe and describe phenomena without judgment, while normative sciences establish and apply criteria for evaluation. 
    * > "Positive science is an object of phenomena, as we see it, as we perceive it, and define it in that way. So in a positive science, there is no question of judging it is object in any way."
    * **Examples:**
        * **Botany:** Describes plant characteristics without judging them as good or bad. [🔉](https://youtu.be/PG3fm2f8jSI?t=387)
        * **Psychology:** Defines mental processes without labeling them as good or bad. [🔉](https://youtu.be/PG3fm2f8jSI?t=826)
        * **Ethics:** Evaluates human actions as right or wrong based on established standards. [🔉](https://youtu.be/PG3fm2f8jSI?t=906)
* **Conduct:**  The collective term for voluntary actions, those done with conscious intent and free will. [🔉](https://youtu.be/PG3fm2f8jSI?t=1041)
    * **Voluntary vs. Involuntary Actions:**  Voluntary actions are under our control, while involuntary actions occur without conscious choice (e.g., heartbeat, reflexes). 
    * > "Conduct is the collective name for voluntary actions. What is voluntary? We do it with our own will." [🔉](https://youtu.be/PG3fm2f8jSI?t=1041)

### Ethical Judgment and the Limits of Conduct [🔉](https://youtu.be/PG3fm2f8jSI?t=902)

* **Ethical Judgments:** Ethics examines whether an individual could have prevented a particular action by consciously choosing not to act. [🔉](https://youtu.be/PG3fm2f8jSI?t=1390)
    * > "So, this question for ethics is not whether such an action was deliberately willed but whether the duo could have prevented it by taking part about it." [🔉](https://youtu.be/PG3fm2f8jSI?t=1390)
    * **Example:**  If someone impulsively reacts in anger and hurts another person, ethics would assess whether they could have controlled their reaction given enough time to consider the consequences.
* **Conduct Limitations in Ethics:** [🔉](https://youtu.be/PG3fm2f8jSI?t=455)
    * **Human Conduct Only:** Ethics focuses solely on human actions, excluding animal behavior. 
    * > "We only talk about human conduct in conduct, and not of the lower animals."  [🔉](https://youtu.be/PG3fm2f8jSI?t=1569)
    * **Voluntary Actions Only:**  Ethics deals with actions that are under conscious control, excluding involuntary reflexes or instincts.
    * > "We have already said that conduct means the voluntary actions are not done by our minds."  [🔉](https://youtu.be/PG3fm2f8jSI?t=1665)

### Points to Ponder

* How do we establish ethical standards for judging human conduct? [🔉](https://youtu.be/PG3fm2f8jSI?t=1537)
* What are the challenges in applying ethical principles to real-world situations?

### Key Takeaways

* Ethics is a normative science that systematically studies and judges human conduct based on established standards of right and wrong. 
*  Ethical judgment focuses on whether individuals could have prevented an action by consciously choosing a different course.
*  Ethics is limited to judging voluntary actions of humans, excluding animal behavior and involuntary reflexes.  [🔉](https://youtu.be/PG3fm2f8jSI?t=419)


###  2. Limitations of Ethics

This section explores the limitations of ethics as a field of study. [🔉](https://youtu.be/PG3fm2f8jSI?t=485)

**Summary:** Ethics is primarily concerned with judging voluntary human actions within a social context. It doesn't encompass animal behavior, involuntary reflexes, or actions without social implications.

* **Voluntary Actions:** Ethics focuses on actions that are consciously chosen, excluding involuntary reflexes or animal behavior. The distinction between voluntary and involuntary actions can be complex, especially when considering animal behavior.
* **Social Context:** Ethical judgments apply to human beings living in societies. The actions under consideration must have an impact on other members of the society. This emphasizes the social dimension of morality.
* **Robin Crusoe Example:**  The example of Robinson Crusoe, stranded on a desert island, illustrates this limitation. His actions might not be judged by the standards of ethics, as they occur outside a social context. His actions would be judged based on the social norms he was exposed to before being stranded.
* **Cultural Differences:** The example also highlights how ethical judgments are influenced by cultural backgrounds. Different societies have different standards of right and wrong, as exemplified by variations in dietary practices (e.g., vegetarianism vs. meat consumption). 
* **Social Effects:**  Even seemingly private actions, like fasting, have indirect social effects. While fasting might not directly affect others, it limits social interaction due to the inability to share food.
* **Emphasis on Social Context:** The focus on social context helps understand the origins of moral values. Moral values emerge from interactions within a society and are influenced by social institutions and relationships.

### 3. Ambiguous Ethical Terms

This section examines the ambiguity of common ethical terms like "good," "bad," "right," and "wrong." [🔉](https://youtu.be/PG3fm2f8jSI?t=1456)

**Summary:**  The meaning of these terms can be subjective and context-dependent. Understanding these ambiguities is crucial for ethical analysis.

* **The Term "Good":** The term "good" is often used loosely and can refer to anything that is considered favorable or desirable, even in a limited sense.  Examples include "good story" or "good hall."
* **Moral vs. Non-Moral "Good":**  There's a distinction between "good" in a general sense and "good" in a moral sense.  A morally good action is not merely something we find favorable but something worthy of praise or that we "ought" to do. 
* **"Good" and Consequences:**  Ethics often uses "good" and "bad" to describe actions based on their consequences. This is ambiguous because consequences can be evaluated in various ways.  [🔉](https://youtu.be/PG3fm2f8jSI?t=2227)
* **"Right" and "Wrong":**  The terms "right" and "wrong" are not primarily about consequences. They focus on the appropriateness of actions within certain contexts.  [🔉](https://youtu.be/PG3fm2f8jSI?t=1751)
* **"Right" and Rules:**  The rightness of an action is often linked to its conformity with rules or social norms. [🔉](https://youtu.be/PG3fm2f8jSI?t=1998)
* **"Right" and Obligation:**  The term "right" sometimes suggests an obligation to act in a certain way. However, this obligation doesn't necessarily imply compulsion. [🔉](https://youtu.be/PG3fm2f8jSI?t=2383)
* **"Ought" and "Duty":**  The phrases "ought to do" and "duty" imply a stronger sense of obligation than "right."  They suggest that a particular action is not only right but also something we should feel compelled to do. 
* **Distinguishing "Ought" and "Good":**  While something might be "good" to do, it doesn't necessarily mean we "ought" to do it.  For example, eating ice cream on a hot day might be pleasant but not a moral obligation.
* **Multiple Right Actions:**  It's possible for multiple actions to be "right" at the same time.  This suggests that "rightness" can be context-dependent. [🔉](https://youtu.be/PG3fm2f8jSI?t=2550)
* **"Ought" and Single Right Action:**  The phrase "it is my duty" implies that only one action is right at a given moment. However, this can be a misleading interpretation, as situations might allow for multiple right actions.
* **Ambiguity in Ethical Terms:** The speaker acknowledges the inherent ambiguity of ethical terms and the importance of carefully defining their meaning to avoid confusion and inconsistency.

### Conclusion

The speaker emphasizes the importance of clear definitions in ethical discourse. Ethical terms, unlike scientific terms, are frequently used in everyday conversation, leading to potential shifts in meaning and emphasis.  The speaker encourages the audience to engage in ethical analysis by carefully considering the nuances of ethical language.
