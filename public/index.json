The main goal is to equip students with the necessary tools and techniques to manage their projects effectively.\nImportance of Project Management in Game Development 🔉 Project management is crucial for the success of video game development. 🔉 \u0026ldquo;You really do need some good project management skills to successfully make video games.\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;The better your project management, the better your chances of coming out with a good game.\u0026rdquo; 🔉 Without project management, the chances of a game project failing are significantly high. 🔉 Project management involves planning, organizing, securing, motivating, and controlling resources to achieve project goals. 🔉 It\u0026rsquo;s about predicting the necessary actions, timing, and methods to ensure project success. The Challenges of Traditional Waterfall Model 🔉 Waterfall model is a traditional project management approach where each phase is completed before moving to the next. It involves sequential stages: Concepting/Design: Defining the project scope, features, and constraints. Pre-Production: Testing assumptions and validating design choices. 🔉 Production: Implementation of the game features. Alpha: Initial testing with a small group of testers. 🔉 Beta: More extensive testing with a larger group, potentially open to the public. 🔉 Shipping: Release of the final product. The major flaw of the waterfall model is the concentration of testing at the end of the project. 🔉 This late testing can lead to significant design changes and rework, which can strain resources and budgets. The inability to predict fun and engage users effectively during the early stages is a crucial problem. In a game, user satisfaction is paramount, and late changes can severely impact its success. Games are unique because they rely on player engagement and enjoyment, which cannot be fully predicted or designed without user interaction. \u0026ldquo;You can\u0026rsquo;t predict fun. You can\u0026rsquo;t design an engaging experience without interacting with the people who are going to be using it.\u0026rdquo; 🔉\nThe Agile Manifesto: A Shift Towards Iteration and Flexibility 🔉 The Agile manifesto advocates for an iterative and flexible approach to project management. It prioritizes: Individuals and interactions over processes and tools. 🔉 Working software over comprehensive documentation. 🔉 Customer collaboration over contract negotiation. 🔉 Responding to change over following a plan. 🔉 Agile emphasizes communication, collaboration, and continuous feedback. It encourages adapting to change and iteratively improving the product throughout the development process. 🔉 \u0026ldquo;The one thing that they have in common is that they try to follow the Agile manifesto, which is individuals and directions over processes and tools.\u0026rdquo;\nThe Agile Development Model: Iterative and User-Focused 🔉 The Agile development model incorporates iterative cycles called sprints. 🔉 Each sprint involves: Design: Creating and refining the design for a specific feature. 🔉 Implementation: Building and implementing the chosen feature. Testing: Validating the functionality and user experience of the feature. 🔉 Review: Assessing the progress of the project and making adjustments based on feedback. The Agile model encourages early user feedback and continuous improvement. By focusing on delivering working software in small increments, it allows for more efficient resource allocation and avoids wasting time on features that may not be valuable to users. \u0026ldquo;Agile can\u0026rsquo;t make you write code faster. What it can do is make sure that the code you\u0026rsquo;re writing is the code you want as opposed to the code that you end up cutting at the end of the project.\u0026rdquo; 🔉\nCaveats and Challenges of Agile Development Agile is not a perfect solution and requires ongoing refinement and adaptation. It assumes that developers are interchangeable, which is not always the case, especially in game development. 🔉 Agile development requires careful consideration of team member skills and dependencies to ensure efficient task allocation. Key Takeaways Project management is crucial for successful game development. The traditional waterfall model has limitations, particularly in its late testing phase. 🔉 The Agile manifesto emphasizes user-centricity, collaboration, and continuous improvement. The Agile development model fosters iterative development, early user feedback, and efficient resource allocation. While Agile offers advantages, it requires careful consideration of team skills and dependencies. Agile Software Development: Scrum and User Stories Challenges with Agile Development This section explores the challenges of implementing Agile methods, particularly in teams with diverse skillsets and communication styles.\nCommunication Barriers: Teams composed of individuals with different backgrounds and training often experience communication difficulties. This is especially true in game development, where programmers and artists may struggle to understand each other\u0026rsquo;s technical requirements and workflows. \u0026ldquo;The artists will not be able to explain why they can\u0026rsquo;t meet the programmer\u0026rsquo;s technical requirements, and the programmers will be unwilling to figure out why it is the artists can\u0026rsquo;t meet those technical requirements. They\u0026rsquo;ve given the technical requirements. Why don\u0026rsquo;t you just make something that works in it?\u0026rdquo;\nImpact on Agile Success: These communication breakdowns can severely hinder the progress of Agile teams, as effective communication is crucial for problem-solving and collaboration. Introduction to Scrum This section provides an overview of Scrum, a specific Agile framework, and its core principles.\nScrum Buzzwords: Transparency, inspection, and adaptability are the guiding principles of Scrum, emphasizing openness, continuous evaluation, and flexibility. \u0026ldquo;You can think of them as scrum\u0026rsquo;s vision statement, but shorter than a document. Essentially, if you are doing scrum right, all of your decisions and processes are transparent.\u0026rdquo;\nTransparency: All team members are informed about decisions and processes, ensuring no one feels excluded or uninformed. Inspection: The team constantly evaluates its actions, decisions, and deliverables, proactively identifying and addressing potential issues. Adaptability: The team adapts its processes and decisions to accommodate changing circumstances and address unforeseen problems. Scrum Team Structure and Responsibilities 🔉 This section describes the different roles within a Scrum team and their respective responsibilities.\nTeam Responsibilities: In Scrum, the team itself is responsible for project management, guided by its members. 🔉 \u0026ldquo;In Scrum, the responsibility for project management doesn\u0026rsquo;t sit with a producer or design lead or the programming lead. It\u0026rsquo;s the team\u0026rsquo;s responsibility guided by the team members to manage their own project.\u0026rdquo;\nProduct Owner: The product owner is responsible for the overall vision of the product. They create and prioritize the product backlog, ensure features are implemented as intended, and provide feedback to the team. \u0026ldquo;The product owner is the person who holds the sole vision of the product. For classic Scrum teams, the product owner is the person who creates the product backlog, helps them prioritize it, and lets them know which of their features are the most important, and whether or not the features as implemented are working the way they need to.\u0026rdquo;\nScrum Master: The Scrum Master facilitates and mediates team meetings, ensures Scrum practices are followed, and keeps track of project documentation. They act as a coach for the team, promoting collaboration and efficient workflows. \u0026ldquo;The Scrum Master is the lucky person who runs the meetings, serves as the facilitator and the mediator, and is in charge of making sure that Scrum is followed and the team is working reasonably smoothly.\u0026rdquo; 🔉\nScrum Project Cycle: Sprints This section describes the overall Scrum project cycle and the role of sprints in dividing the work into manageable chunks.\nSprints: Sprints are iterative development cycles, typically lasting one to two weeks, during which the team focuses on completing a set of features. 🔉 \u0026ldquo;A sprint is the way that a Scrum project divides up its design iteration cycles. Sprint length depends on the project and what the team wants.\u0026rdquo;\nSprint Cycle: The Scrum cycle includes pre-game sprint, development sprints, and wrapper sprints. Pre-game Sprint: The initial phase where the team defines the project vision, outlines features, and establishes the product backlog. Development Sprints: Iterative cycles where the team develops, tests, and refines features from the product backlog. Wrapper Sprints: Final sprints dedicated to polishing and testing the product to ensure all systems function correctly. Scrum Meetings and Artifacts 🔉 This section details the meetings and tools used by Scrum teams to manage their work effectively.\nMeetings: Sprint Planning Meeting: At the beginning of each sprint, the team selects features from the product backlog to include in the current sprint, creating the sprint backlog. 🔉 Daily Scrum: A brief daily meeting where team members discuss their progress, challenges, and plans for the day. Sprint Review: At the end of each sprint, the team reviews its accomplishments, compares them to goals, and updates the product backlog based on feedback. 🔉 Retrospective: A dedicated meeting focused on reviewing the team\u0026rsquo;s processes and identifying areas for improvement. 🔉 Artifacts: Product Backlog: A prioritized list of all features to be implemented in the project. Sprint Backlog: A subset of the product backlog containing the features selected for the current sprint. Task List: A detailed breakdown of tasks needed to complete each feature in the sprint backlog. Scrum Board: A visual representation of the sprint backlog and task progress, allowing the team to track their work and identify potential bottlenecks. \u0026ldquo;If you\u0026rsquo;ve got a team that all works in the same place, it\u0026rsquo;s usually a physical, big physical board. That you have room to put cards with all the tasks on it on and you just have it divided up into sections to show the status of each task.\u0026rdquo;\nUser Stories: Building a Product Backlog 🔉 This section explains the importance of user stories in creating a comprehensive and effective product backlog.\nProduct Backlog: More Than Just a Feature List: The product backlog is not just a list of features; it\u0026rsquo;s a tool for prioritizing and organizing features, ensuring the team focuses on the most critical aspects of the project. \u0026ldquo;So it is an organized, prioritized feature list. So the team always knows what the most important next feature is.\u0026rdquo; 🔉\nUser Story Format: User stories are a common format for describing features in the product backlog. They follow a simple structure: \u0026ldquo;As a [user type], I want to [action], so that [benefit].\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;As an unauthorized user, I want to create a new account, so that I can access the application.\u0026rdquo; 🔉\nEstimating Feature Size: The backlog includes an estimation of the effort required to complete each feature, typically using a simple scale like \u0026ldquo;small,\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;medium,\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;large,\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;extra-large.\u0026rdquo; 🔉 \u0026ldquo;You can say, what are all the smallest features here and call those small. All the medium features are medium, and all the big features that are really going to take a lot of work, you can call them extra-large.\u0026rdquo;\nPoints to Ponder How do communication barriers impact team dynamics and productivity? What strategies can be used to address these barriers? 🔉 How does Scrum\u0026rsquo;s emphasis on transparency, inspection, and adaptability contribute to project success? What are the advantages and disadvantages of having a product owner on a team? Key Takeaways Agile development requires careful consideration of team skills, dependencies, and communication styles. Scrum is an Agile framework that emphasizes transparency, inspection, and adaptability. Scrum teams are responsible for managing their own projects, guided by a Scrum Master and a product owner (if available). 🔉 Sprints provide a structured framework for iterative development and progress tracking. User stories are a valuable tool for creating a comprehensive and prioritized product backlog. Product Backlog\nThis section focuses on defining and creating a product backlog for the game.\nDefining the Backlog: The backlog is a list of features for the game, prioritized by importance. It\u0026rsquo;s a living document that evolves as the game\u0026rsquo;s development progresses.\nEstimation: The speaker suggests using rough estimation to get a feel for the overall size of the features. This means grouping similar-sized features and focusing on their relative size rather than precise hours. For example, if a \u0026ldquo;small\u0026rdquo; feature takes 3 hours, then other small features are likely to take a similar amount of time.\n\u0026ldquo;What is bigger than that? That is probably a medium. What is the biggest feature I can see here? Make that a large. When you are making the product backlog, it really is, you do not want to spend a lot of time figuring out estimation and trying to figure out exactly how many hours it is going to take, and how many subtasks are involved.\u0026rdquo;\nLarge Features: Some features might be massive and need to be broken down into smaller units. The speaker suggests acknowledging these features as \u0026ldquo;extra-extra-large\u0026rdquo; and breaking them down later when the team is ready to implement them.\n\u0026ldquo;It is not a single one feature. It is a whole bunch of different things. So if you come across features that clearly dwarf everything else that you have got is you should try to bring those down into small units and not chunks.\u0026rdquo; 🔉\nUser Stories: A specific format for describing features in a clear, testable, and understandable manner.\n\u0026ldquo;A user story is just a very specific way to describe a feature. It is, I think, unique to Scrum, although there may be other agile methodologies that have stolen it as a way of describing a feature.\u0026rdquo;\nFormat:\nAs the person who will use the feature. 🔉 I want to do something. So that I can achieve this. Example: As a player, I want to be able to move around the game board so that I can explore and interact with the environment. 🔉\nBenefits:\nTestable: Ensures that features are easily validated. User-Focused: Keeps the development process focused on the user experience. Reason Provided: Gives context for the feature and helps to ensure that it meets the needs of the game. Benefits of User Stories\nClear Communication: Helps to ensure that everyone understands the feature\u0026rsquo;s purpose and how to test it. Reduced Waste: Prevents the team from spending time on unnecessary work. \u0026ldquo;You are not doing work that does not need to be done that is going to get cut later on. And so a lot of the tools and a lot of the processes and a lot of the language and a lot of meetings are all about making sure that before you go out and put a lot of time into something, it is really the thing that you want to be doing. Okay, and user stories are just one more way to add that check into your process.\u0026rdquo; 🔉\nTeam Project Presentations\nThe lecture then shifts to a team-based exercise where each group presents their game\u0026rsquo;s product backlog. Here are some of the games and their core features:\nComcastic: A game where players place internet service stations to build a monopoly. 🔉\nCore Features: Town map Piece placement and rotation Turn mechanics Money tracking Line Dance: A game that aims to be creepy and enthralling. 🔉\nCore Features: Start menu Main screen Character and alien movement Interactions between aliens and characters Shooting Plunderwinds: A turn-based grid-based game with random encounters, exploration, and a wind mechanic. 🔉\nCore Features: Random encounter mechanic Exploration mechanic Wind mechanic Lost 100 Grand: A game where players try to get the most money by placing bombs and moving around the game board.\nCore Features: Game board Bomb placement Moving around the board Revolution: A turn-based game where players progress their beaver quality by making choices each turn. 🔉\nCore Features: Game board Dam building mechanics UI to track resources and beaver quality Magi Dice: A puzzle game where players use modular arithmetic to create zeros and combo chains.\nCore Features: Game board with dice Combo mechanics UI to display points and incentivize combos Sparkly Redemption: A real-time game where players shoot monsters and collect sparklies to gain new weapons and change monster behavior. 🔉\nCore Features: Player character that can move and shoot Monsters with at least two behaviors Sparklies that can be picked up Scrum Meetings\nThe lecture concludes by discussing the different types of Scrum meetings and how they can be used to optimize the development process.\nTime Boxing: A key concept in Scrum, where each meeting or activity is given a specific time limit. This helps to ensure that meetings are productive and efficient.\n\u0026ldquo;Time boxing is when you decide before you have the meeting or before you start any particular activity how much time you are going to let it take.\u0026rdquo;\nClear Agenda: It is important to have a clear agenda for each meeting so that everyone knows the purpose of the meeting and what is expected of them.\n\u0026ldquo;There are three primary tools to do this that we are going to talk about here. We are going to talk about time boxing, having a clear agenda and having involved participants.\u0026rdquo;\nInvolved Participants: All participants should be actively involved in the meeting. This means that they should be prepared, engaged, and willing to contribute.\nBenefits of Time Boxing 🔉\nFocus: Time boxing helps to keep meetings focused on the most important topics.\nEfficiency: It prevents meetings from dragging on unnecessarily.\nDecision-Making: Encourages the team to make decisions within the allotted time.\n\u0026ldquo;It does mean that you won\u0026rsquo;t always reach the perfect solution because after you\u0026rsquo;ve been talking, if you\u0026rsquo;ve given yourself an hour to discuss a problem and you\u0026rsquo;ve talked about it for an hour and you haven\u0026rsquo;t quite come to a great solution, you stop talking anyway. You decide what the most reasonable solution you\u0026rsquo;ve talked about is and you go ahead and do that.\u0026rdquo; 🔉\nThe enemy of perfect is good: By forcing decisions within the time box, the team is less likely to get bogged down in details and can move forward with a workable solution.\n\u0026ldquo;It\u0026rsquo;s an implementation of a theory that the perfect is the enemy of the good.\u0026rdquo; 🔉\nSummary of Key Points\nUser Stories: A valuable tool for defining features and ensuring they are clear, testable, and user-focused. 🔉 Product Backlog: A prioritized list of features for the game that can be used to guide the development process. Scrum Meetings: An essential part of the Scrum process that help to ensure collaboration, communication, and efficiency. Time Boxing: A key principle in Scrum that helps to keep meetings productive and prevent wasted time. [Image_query: A Scrum team working together in a meeting]\nTime Boxing Time boxing is a technique used in Agile software development to allocate a specific amount of time to a task or meeting. It prevents discussions from becoming too lengthy and encourages teams to focus on finding the best solution within the allocated time. \u0026ldquo;It may be better, and it usually is better, to go ahead with the best solution you came up with and start implementing that and see how it works.\u0026rdquo;\nEffective Meetings Clear Agenda: Every meeting should have a defined purpose, goal, and desired outcome. \u0026ldquo;If you don\u0026rsquo;t know why you are having a meeting, you probably shouldn\u0026rsquo;t be having it.\u0026rdquo; 🔉\nFocused Participation: Only those who are directly involved in the meeting should attend. \u0026ldquo;Not all meetings require the whole team.\u0026rdquo; 🔉\nActive Engagement: All participants should be present and actively participating in the discussion. 🔉 \u0026ldquo;Be in the meeting. Don\u0026rsquo;t be coding in the background. Don\u0026rsquo;t be checking your cell phone and texting something.\u0026rdquo; 🔉\nTime Boxing: Meetings should be timeboxed to ensure they stay focused and productive. \u0026ldquo;Go ahead and be there. Except that you have dedicated the next 15 or 20 minutes to working with your co-workers to solve this particular problem, get the problem solved, get the meeting over, and then get back to your useful things.\u0026rdquo; 🔉\nScrum Meetings Breakdown Sprint Planning Meeting Goal: To set the team\u0026rsquo;s goals for the upcoming sprint and create a sprint backlog with estimated tasks. 🔉 Deliverables: A sprint backlog and an estimated task list. Timebox: 1-2 hours (1 hour for smaller teams, 1.5 hours for inexperienced teams). Process: Review the Product Backlog: The team reviews the product backlog created in previous stages to understand the overall project goals. 🔉 Select User Stories: The team selects a subset of user stories from the product backlog that they aim to complete in the sprint. Break Down Stories into Tasks: User stories are broken down into smaller, more manageable tasks. Estimate Task Duration: Each task is assigned an estimated time to complete it. Create Sprint Backlog: The selected user stories and their associated tasks are organized into a sprint backlog, which serves as the roadmap for the sprint. Benefits: Helps the team to focus on the most important tasks. 🔉 Provides a clear roadmap for the sprint. 🔉 Enables the team to track progress and identify potential roadblocks.

The instructor, emphasizing that negotiation is an essential but often disliked aspect of business, encourages participants to explore their feelings and experiences. The session aims to demystify negotiation and equip participants with insights to navigate challenging situations.\nNegotiation Preferences\nThe majority of participants are indifferent towards negotiation, viewing it as necessary but not enjoyable, similar to eating broccoli. A small percentage enjoys negotiation, citing reasons such as: Sense of control: Negotiation offers a platform for exercising control and feeling confident in decision-making. Improved situation: The opportunity to improve the current situation, leading to a better outcome. Win-win deals: The satisfaction of achieving mutually beneficial agreements. Creativity: Negotiation allows for creative solutions tailored to unique situations. Understanding: Negotiation provides deeper insight into the other party\u0026rsquo;s needs and desires. Those who dislike negotiation cite reasons such as: Fear of being outmaneuvered: The discomfort of feeling unprepared or lacking the necessary information to negotiate effectively. Regret of outcomes: The feeling of regret after a negotiation, believing a better deal could have been achieved. Dealing with difficult personalities: The frustration of encountering aggressive or manipulative negotiation tactics. Power imbalances: The feeling of being exploited or taken advantage of due to power or information disparities. The Instructor\u0026rsquo;s Experience\nThe instructor, with extensive experience in real estate transactions and business acquisitions, emphasizes that negotiation is a crucial skill in diverse contexts. He shares his personal experiences with both enjoyable and challenging negotiations, highlighting that negotiation can be a rewarding yet stressful experience.\nEveryone is an Expert Negotiator\nThe instructor asserts that everyone is an expert negotiator, as they have effectively navigated life\u0026rsquo;s various situations, each requiring negotiation.\nTypes of Negotiations\nThe instructor introduces a spectrum of negotiations:\nInformal: Casual conversations with friends and family. Stylized: Business negotiations involving agreements and structured discussions. Formal: Highly structured negotiations with formal rules and procedures, often in litigation or arbitration. What Makes for Successful Negotiations?\nThe instructor emphasizes that successful negotiations are characterized by:\nMeeting Expectations: Achieving the desired objectives and feeling satisfied with the outcome. Perception and Strategy: Effectively understanding the negotiation landscape and executing a well-defined strategy. Win-win outcomes: Achieving mutually beneficial agreements that leave both parties feeling satisfied. Common Business Negotiation Focus\nThe instructor notes that most business negotiations center around five key areas:\nPrice: Securing the best possible price. Terms: Negotiating favorable terms and conditions. Timelines: Establishing acceptable timeframes for execution and deliverables. Warranties: Ensuring appropriate warranties are in place. Remedies: Establishing remedies in case of unforeseen issues. Unsuccessful Negotiation Techniques\nThe instructor identifies several techniques commonly used in negotiations that may lead to unfavorable outcomes:\nBathroom Break: Deliberately delaying the negotiation process by taking extended breaks, pressuring the other party. Deadlines: Using artificial deadlines to create pressure and influence the negotiation. Slow Speaking: Slowing down the pace of the negotiation to create tension and anxiety. Last-minute Objections: Raising objections at the last minute to disrupt the negotiation process. Misinformation: Providing false or misleading information to gain an advantage. Physical Discomfort: Creating an uncomfortable environment to put the other party at a disadvantage. Abusive Language: Using offensive language to intimidate or demoralize the other party. How to Handle Unsuccessful Negotiation Tactics\nCall out the behavior: Directly address the other party\u0026rsquo;s tactics in a calm and professional manner. Document the behavior: Record any instances of inappropriate behavior for future reference. Points to Ponder\nHow can we differentiate between genuine mistakes and deliberate attempts to deceive in negotiations? How can we effectively navigate negotiations with individuals who employ manipulative or abusive tactics? Key Takeaways\nSuccessful negotiation involves understanding the landscape, developing a strategy, and striving for mutually beneficial outcomes. While negotiation can be challenging, everyone has the capacity to negotiate effectively. Recognizing and addressing manipulative tactics is crucial to achieving positive results. Practical Keys to Successful Negotiation This section explores practical strategies for achieving positive negotiation outcomes, drawing upon real-world experiences and emphasizing the importance of relationship building and strategic thinking.\nSummary: This section discusses the importance of choosing the right negotiation partner, building trust, understanding BATNA, knowing the difference between battles and wars, sharing information, being aware of manipulative tactics, and understanding the other party\u0026rsquo;s values.\nNegotiating with the Right Party Key Point: Ensure you\u0026rsquo;re negotiating with the individual who has the authority to make decisions. \u0026ldquo;You would be amazed at how many negotiations go on with the wrong party, with the unempowered lieutenant, with somebody who really is not the decision maker, whatever.\u0026rdquo; Example: A negotiation for financing in Spain where the speaker and his team were negotiating with a representative who had no authority to make a deal. This resulted in a wasted negotiation. Lesson: Thoroughly vet your negotiation partner to ensure they have the necessary authority and power to make a deal. Building Trust Key Point: Trust is crucial in negotiations. It is based on a combination of character, competence, and power. \u0026ldquo;For somebody to be trusted, they have to be high character. They have to be competent. And they have to be empowered to make a decision.\u0026rdquo; Note: Trust needs to be reciprocated for successful negotiations. Example: The speaker\u0026rsquo;s experience with negotiating joint ventures with a life insurance company where the executive made it clear that the negotiation was not about reaching a mutually agreeable deal. \u0026ldquo;Joel, sit down. Just take notes. Your job here is just to take notes. We\u0026rsquo;re not negotiating anything. Just take notes. We\u0026rsquo;re the life company. We\u0026rsquo;ve got all the money. You\u0026rsquo;re just the developer. Take notes.\u0026rdquo; Lesson: Building trust with your negotiation partner is essential. Assess their character, competence, and power, and strive to be equally trustworthy yourself. Understanding BATNA Key Point: BATNA stands for Best Alternative To a Negotiated Agreement. It\u0026rsquo;s your best option if the current negotiation fails. \u0026ldquo;That\u0026rsquo;s Best Alternative To a Negotiated Agreement. OK, this is a term that was developed by Fisher and Yuri in 1981 out of the Harvard Negotiation study, which they really found that if people could go into a negotiation with an idea of what is their best alternative to this negotiation working out successfully, they came out with better end results.\u0026rdquo; Note: Knowing your BATNA gives you confidence and leverage in negotiations. Example: The speaker\u0026rsquo;s early career ambition to be known as a negotiator who wouldn\u0026rsquo;t budge on price. This led to a situation where the speaker, needing to secure a deal, had to find another investor to make it happen. Lesson: Develop a clear understanding of your BATNA. It\u0026rsquo;s your fallback position and allows you to make informed decisions during negotiations. Identifying Elephants and Ants Key Point: Recognize the difference between important negotiation points (elephants) and less critical ones (ants). \u0026ldquo;Have you ever negotiated with somebody for whom every deal point is something that they have to win? Everything is competitive. Everything that\u0026rsquo;s brought up, they have to win every deal point. I\u0026rsquo;m here to submit to you that that\u0026rsquo;s a really dumb way to negotiate.\u0026rdquo; Note: Be willing to concede on some minor points to secure larger, more important outcomes. Example: The speaker\u0026rsquo;s experience teaching a negotiation course at Stanford where students were instructed to \u0026ldquo;win\u0026rdquo; the negotiation. This led to a competitive environment, making deals more difficult and relationships strained. \u0026ldquo;People were frustrated. People were frustrated and they hated their classmates. They said, “I will never do business with these turkeys again. I had no idea these people were such jerks.\u0026rdquo; Lesson: Prioritize your negotiation goals. Identify the key issues (elephants) and be prepared to compromise on less important points (ants) to achieve a successful outcome. Sharing Information Key Point: Sharing information can create a more collaborative negotiation environment. \u0026ldquo;So there\u0026rsquo;s a lot more sharing of information in that kind of a model of negotiation. It doesn\u0026rsquo;t always. It\u0026rsquo;s not always something you can do.\u0026rdquo; Example: The speaker\u0026rsquo;s experience with negotiating deals with a limited partner who liked to negotiate price. \u0026ldquo;He said, “Joel, I just got to tell you, I like to negotiate price. I don\u0026rsquo;t feel good unless I can negotiate price. So if you want it to be a million dollars, tell me it\u0026rsquo;s a million 50. Just tell me it\u0026rsquo;s a million 50. I\u0026rsquo;ll come back with a million. And then we\u0026rsquo;ll both feel good.” \u0026quot; Lesson: Consider the benefits of sharing information to foster transparency and a collaborative negotiation atmosphere. This can lead to creative solutions and mutually beneficial outcomes. Recognizing and Handling Manipulative Tactics Key Point: Be aware of common manipulative tactics, but don\u0026rsquo;t let them derail the negotiation. \u0026ldquo;You have to be aware of them. You have to be. And it tells you something. If somebody\u0026rsquo;s using, I was thinking when somebody\u0026rsquo;s shouting at me or walking out of the room or throwing things, there\u0026rsquo;s information in that.\u0026rdquo; Note: Use questioning and information gathering to defuse situations. Example: The speaker\u0026rsquo;s experience with a real estate partner who used manipulative tactics like throwing things and shouting to get his way. \u0026ldquo;In any document that\u0026rsquo;s that thick, there\u0026rsquo;s something in it for me.\u0026rdquo; Lesson: Be prepared for manipulative tactics. Stay calm, use questioning to gain information, and don\u0026rsquo;t be afraid to call them out. This can often lead to a more productive negotiation. Understanding the Other Party\u0026rsquo;s Values Key Point: Gaining insight into the other party\u0026rsquo;s values helps you create solutions that meet their needs. \u0026ldquo;The more you can understand their values, and I\u0026rsquo;ll tell you stories in them that illustrate each of these, but the more you can understand really what it is that drives them, what\u0026rsquo;s important to them, the more likely you are to craft a solution to things that satisfies what it is that\u0026rsquo;s important to them.\u0026rdquo; Note: This is crucial for achieving win-win outcomes. Example: The speaker\u0026rsquo;s experience with a senior partner who wanted to agree on values for a property deal. However, the speaker recognized that disagreeing on values allowed him to select deals where he felt he was getting a better outcome. Lesson: Go beyond just understanding the other party\u0026rsquo;s objectives. Seek to understand their underlying values and motivations to create solutions that are mutually beneficial. Win-Lose vs. Win-Win Negotiations Key Point: Negotiations can be either win-lose (competitive) or win-win (collaborative). \u0026ldquo;Those of you who dread negotiations probably have experienced some of this win-lose experience, those of you who said you really enjoyed them have probably experienced more of the left-hand column.\u0026rdquo; Note: The win-win approach leads to more successful and sustainable relationships. Example: The speaker\u0026rsquo;s experience teaching a negotiation course where changing the mindset from \u0026ldquo;win\u0026rdquo; to \u0026ldquo;have fun\u0026rdquo; resulted in more successful outcomes and improved relationships. \u0026ldquo;People came out of it saying, “Man, this was a fun exercise. We like each other. Aren\u0026rsquo;t Stanford MBAs cool? I just really love my classmates.\u0026rdquo; Lesson: Strive for win-win outcomes in negotiations. By focusing on collaboration and mutual benefit, you can create stronger relationships and more sustainable agreements. Negotiation Mindsets and Building a Brand Summary: This section delves into the importance of establishing a brand as a negotiator, highlighting that every negotiation, no matter how small, builds your reputation. It emphasizes that negotiations are not just one-off events but part of a broader, ongoing series of interactions. The speaker also provides practical examples and insights into developing the right mindset for successful negotiations, particularly emphasizing the value of trust and communication.\nThe Brand of a Negotiator Every negotiation contributes to your brand. [Image_query] A visual representation of different brands of negotiators. Think beyond episodic: Each negotiation is part of a larger, ongoing series. \u0026ldquo;There are no episodic negotiations. You may think it\u0026rsquo;s an episode. You may think you\u0026rsquo;re going in and having a one-off deal with somebody.\u0026rdquo;\nDevelop a brand: Consciously consider the kind of reputation you want to build as a negotiator. \u0026ldquo;Think carefully about the brand you want to have.\u0026rdquo;\nExample: The speaker\u0026rsquo;s brand evolved from \u0026ldquo;never sues\u0026rdquo; to \u0026ldquo;very reasonable but firm when crossed,\u0026rdquo; making him a formidable yet fair negotiator. \u0026ldquo;So that\u0026rsquo;s a better brand than the brand I had before, which was the guy will never sue.\u0026rdquo;\nNegotiating with Your Children: A Case Study The speaker shares a negotiation with his daughter about getting a rat. Initial volley: The daughter presents a strong case, using emotional appeals and framing the decision as a simple matter of responsibility. \u0026ldquo;Do you hear that I\u0026rsquo;m getting a rat? Won\u0026rsquo;t that be cool?\u0026rdquo;\nSpeaker\u0026rsquo;s response: He uses humor and appeals to shared values, highlighting the downsides of rats and emphasizing his desire to spend time with her. \u0026ldquo;Are you nuts? I\u0026rsquo;ve been killing rats at the house in Woodside.\u0026rdquo;\nOutcome: The daughter gets the rats, demonstrating the power of balance and a willingness to win the \u0026ldquo;war\u0026rdquo; (raising a responsible child) over the \u0026ldquo;battle\u0026rdquo; (the rat issue). \u0026ldquo;She gets the rats, exactly. She got the rats.\u0026rdquo;\nKey Negotiation Insights from the Case Study Balance of power: Be aware of the power dynamics in a negotiation. \u0026ldquo;It\u0026rsquo;s a great point. I\u0026rsquo;ve, besides her mom had already said yes.\u0026rdquo;\nThe \u0026ldquo;elephants and ants\u0026rdquo; approach: Sometimes, it\u0026rsquo;s necessary to concede on small issues to achieve a larger goal. \u0026ldquo;I was willing to lose a battle to win the war.\u0026rdquo;\nDurable agreements: Aim for agreements that are sustainable and built on trust rather than just legal documents. \u0026ldquo;The idea is that your agreement should be durable. There\u0026rsquo;s no point in coming to an agreement that it terminates in a l\u0026hellip; a lawsuit six months later.\u0026rdquo;\nMindsets for Effective Negotiation Negotiation as a conversation: Treat negotiations as an exchange of ideas and interests, not a contest. \u0026ldquo;A negotiation is just a conversation. It\u0026rsquo;s just an exchange.\u0026rdquo;\nThink win-win: Aim for solutions that benefit both parties. \u0026ldquo;Thinking win-win.\u0026rdquo;\nAccountability: Recognize the broader consequences of your actions and the interests of all stakeholders. \u0026ldquo;A lot of times, people think, \u0026lsquo;It\u0026rsquo;s the negotiate. They\u0026rsquo;re only accountable themselves.\u0026rdquo;\nWatch your language: Avoid emotional language, bluffing, or high-velocity words, as they can damage your credibility. \u0026ldquo;Just you think of the words that just sort of raise people\u0026rsquo;s emotional tension and their temperature.\u0026rdquo;\nSet a baseline: Maintain a calm, composed demeanor to increase your influence and maintain control of the situation. \u0026ldquo;Whatever your baseline is, it\u0026rsquo;s the variation from your baseline that will get effect.\u0026rdquo;\nBe trusted: Build a reputation for fairness, honesty, and reliability to foster long-term relationships and agreements. \u0026ldquo;If the other party can trust you over the long run, you\u0026rsquo;ll develop that brand.\u0026rdquo;\nChoosing Your Negotiators Intermediaries matter: Select negotiators carefully, considering their impact on your brand and their ability to facilitate deals. \u0026ldquo;Would you use this as a model for buying, for selecting an intermediary?\u0026rdquo;\nDeal facilitators vs. deal makers: Look for negotiators who are problem solvers and can help close deals rather than those who simply focus on legal technicalities. \u0026ldquo;Are they deal facilitators? Are they deal makers, problem solvers?\u0026rdquo;\nMinimizing Intermediaries Avoid using too many intermediaries: The speaker prefers direct communication with the other party. \u0026ldquo;I don\u0026rsquo;t like to have agents, brokers, investment bankers, or attorneys negotiating my deals.\u0026rdquo;\nMaintain a one-on-one relationship: This approach fosters trust and helps build a stronger brand. Benefits of direct communication: Creates better relationships and outcomes, even if it requires more effort in the short term. Role of intermediaries: While they can be valuable, they should act as advisors rather than negotiators. \u0026ldquo;I like to have a little bit of a background. So I use them that way. But I never put them and say, \u0026lsquo;My attorney will negotiate with your attorney and make a deal.\u0026rsquo;\u0026rdquo;\nModerating Emotions Authenticity is important: Being genuine builds trust with the opposing party. Moderate emotional swings: Avoid extreme reactions and keep emotions in check. Stay within your \u0026ldquo;thresholds\u0026rdquo;: Recognize your personal limits and avoid going beyond them to maintain a good outcome. \u0026ldquo;There are certain thresholds that I don\u0026rsquo;t want to cross, because I spend a lot. If I cross those thresholds, I\u0026rsquo;ve spent something that doesn\u0026rsquo;t return to me what it\u0026rsquo;s worth.\u0026rdquo;\nBe Likable Likability matters: Even in professional settings, a likable demeanor can positively influence negotiations. \u0026ldquo;There is something, even the most jaded, professionally trained litigator who does gladiating for a life, you know, says it makes a difference if you like the other party.\u0026rdquo;\nNo upside in being unpleasant: Being a jerk won\u0026rsquo;t get you anywhere in negotiations. Formal Negotiation Processes Litigation and arbitration: These are undesirable outcomes, often resulting in rigid and inflexible agreements. Mediation: A process of compromise where neither party may feel completely satisfied. Hidden agendas: Be aware of potential hidden agendas that can surface during the implementation phase. Fisher and Ury\u0026rsquo;s Negotiation Principles Getting to Yes: A classic book on negotiation strategies written by Fisher and Ury, two Harvard lawyers. \u0026ldquo;It\u0026rsquo;s still the classic book on the go, I would recommend it to all of you who want to become a better negotiator.\u0026rdquo;\nGetting Past No: A follow-up book that delves deeper into overcoming negotiation challenges. \u0026ldquo;Actually, the second one, though much less read. In fact, is there anybody in here that\u0026rsquo;s read Getting Past No? OK, great. Not very many people have read it. It\u0026rsquo;s actually, I think, even a better, more insightful book.\u0026rdquo;\nFour fundamental principles: Separate the people from the problem: Don\u0026rsquo;t let personal feelings cloud your judgment. Focus on interests, not positions: Understand what the other party truly wants, not just their stated position. Invent options for mutual gain: Think creatively to find solutions that benefit both sides. Insist on objective criteria: Establish a set of criteria to assess the fairness of the deal. Know your BATNA (Best Alternative To a Negotiated Agreement): Understand your fallback options to avoid accepting unfavorable deals. \u0026ldquo;Know what going in, and my corollary to that is calculate the other party\u0026rsquo;s batna.\u0026rdquo;\nFisher and Ury\u0026rsquo;s Practical Strategies Don\u0026rsquo;t blame your opponent: See the situation from their perspective.
