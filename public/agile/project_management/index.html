Introduction
This lecture focuses on introducing project management concepts, specifically Agile methodologies, for developing video games. The main goal is to equip students with the necessary tools and techniques to manage their projects effectively.
Importance of Project Management in Game Development 🔉

Project management is crucial for the success of video game development.   🔉
&ldquo;You really do need some good project management skills to successfully make video games.&rdquo;
&ldquo;The better your project management, the better your chances of coming out with a good game.&rdquo; 🔉
Without project management, the chances of a game project failing are significantly high.  🔉
Project management involves planning, organizing, securing, motivating, and controlling resources to achieve project goals. 🔉
It&rsquo;s about predicting the necessary actions, timing, and methods to ensure project success.

The Challenges of Traditional Waterfall Model 🔉

Waterfall model is a traditional project management approach where each phase is completed before moving to the next. 
It involves sequential stages:

Concepting/Design: Defining the project scope, features, and constraints.
Pre-Production: Testing assumptions and validating design choices. 🔉
Production: Implementation of the game features.
Alpha: Initial testing with a small group of testers. 🔉
Beta: More extensive testing with a larger group, potentially open to the public. 🔉
Shipping: Release of the final product.


The major flaw of the waterfall model is the concentration of testing at the end of the project.   🔉
This late testing can lead to significant design changes and rework, which can strain resources and budgets.
The inability to predict fun and engage users effectively during the early stages is a crucial problem.
In a game, user satisfaction is paramount, and late changes can severely impact its success.
Games are unique because they rely on player engagement and enjoyment, which cannot be fully predicted or designed without user interaction.

The Challenges of Traditional Waterfall Model 🔉 Waterfall model is a traditional project management approach where each phase is completed before moving to the next. It involves sequential stages: Concepting/Design: Defining the project scope, features, and constraints.

The inability to predict fun and engage users effectively during the early stages is a crucial problem. In a game, user satisfaction is paramount, and late changes can severely impact its success. Games are unique because they rely on player engagement and enjoyment, which cannot be fully predicted or designed without user interaction. “You can’t predict fun. You can’t design an engaging experience without interacting with the people who are going to be using it.” 🔉\nThe Agile Manifesto: A Shift Towards Iteration and Flexibility 🔉 The Agile manifesto advocates for an iterative and flexible approach to project management. It prioritizes: Individuals and interactions over processes and tools. 🔉 Working software over comprehensive documentation. 🔉 Customer collaboration over contract negotiation. 🔉 Responding to change over following a plan. 🔉 Agile emphasizes communication, collaboration, and continuous feedback. It encourages adapting to change and iteratively improving the product throughout the development process. 🔉 “The one thing that they have in common is that they try to follow the Agile manifesto, which is individuals and directions over processes and tools.”\nThe Agile Development Model: Iterative and User-Focused 🔉 The Agile development model incorporates iterative cycles called sprints. 🔉 Each sprint involves: Design: Creating and refining the design for a specific feature. 🔉 Implementation: Building and implementing the chosen feature. Testing: Validating the functionality and user experience of the feature. 🔉 Review: Assessing the progress of the project and making adjustments based on feedback. The Agile model encourages early user feedback and continuous improvement. By focusing on delivering working software in small increments, it allows for more efficient resource allocation and avoids wasting time on features that may not be valuable to users. “Agile can’t make you write code faster. What it can do is make sure that the code you’re writing is the code you want as opposed to the code that you end up cutting at the end of the project.” 🔉\nCaveats and Challenges of Agile Development Agile is not a perfect solution and requires ongoing refinement and adaptation. It assumes that developers are interchangeable, which is not always the case, especially in game development. 🔉 Agile development requires careful consideration of team member skills and dependencies to ensure efficient task allocation. Key Takeaways Project management is crucial for successful game development. The traditional waterfall model has limitations, particularly in its late testing phase. 🔉 The Agile manifesto emphasizes user-centricity, collaboration, and continuous improvement. The Agile development model fosters iterative development, early user feedback, and efficient resource allocation. While Agile offers advantages, it requires careful consideration of team skills and dependencies. Agile Software Development: Scrum and User Stories Challenges with Agile Development This section explores the challenges of implementing Agile methods, particularly in teams with diverse skillsets and communication styles.\nCommunication Barriers: Teams composed of individuals with different backgrounds and training often experience communication difficulties. This is especially true in game development, where programmers and artists may struggle to understand each other’s technical requirements and workflows. “The artists will not be able to explain why they can’t meet the programmer’s technical requirements, and the programmers will be unwilling to figure out why it is the artists can’t meet those technical requirements. They’ve given the technical requirements. Why don’t you just make something that works in it?”\nImpact on Agile Success: These communication breakdowns can severely hinder the progress of Agile teams, as effective communication is crucial for problem-solving and collaboration. Introduction to Scrum This section provides an overview of Scrum, a specific Agile framework, and its core principles.\nScrum Buzzwords: Transparency, inspection, and adaptability are the guiding principles of Scrum, emphasizing openness, continuous evaluation, and flexibility. “You can think of them as scrum’s vision statement, but shorter than a document. Essentially, if you are doing scrum right, all of your decisions and processes are transparent.”\nTransparency: All team members are informed about decisions and processes, ensuring no one feels excluded or uninformed. Inspection: The team constantly evaluates its actions, decisions, and deliverables, proactively identifying and addressing potential issues. Adaptability: The team adapts its processes and decisions to accommodate changing circumstances and address unforeseen problems. Scrum Team Structure and Responsibilities 🔉 This section describes the different roles within a Scrum team and their respective responsibilities.\nTeam Responsibilities: In Scrum, the team itself is responsible for project management, guided by its members. 🔉 “In Scrum, the responsibility for project management doesn’t sit with a producer or design lead or the programming lead. It’s the team’s responsibility guided by the team members to manage their own project.”\nProduct Owner: The product owner is responsible for the overall vision of the product. They create and prioritize the product backlog, ensure features are implemented as intended, and provide feedback to the team. “The product owner is the person who holds the sole vision of the product. For classic Scrum teams, the product owner is the person who creates the product backlog, helps them prioritize it, and lets them know which of their features are the most important, and whether or not the features as implemented are working the way they need to.”\nScrum Master: The Scrum Master facilitates and mediates team meetings, ensures Scrum practices are followed, and keeps track of project documentation. They act as a coach for the team, promoting collaboration and efficient workflows. “The Scrum Master is the lucky person who runs the meetings, serves as the facilitator and the mediator, and is in charge of making sure that Scrum is followed and the team is working reasonably smoothly.” 🔉\nScrum Project Cycle: Sprints This section describes the overall Scrum project cycle and the role of sprints in dividing the work into manageable chunks.\nSprints: Sprints are iterative development cycles, typically lasting one to two weeks, during which the team focuses on completing a set of features. 🔉 “A sprint is the way that a Scrum project divides up its design iteration cycles. Sprint length depends on the project and what the team wants.”\nSprint Cycle: The Scrum cycle includes pre-game sprint, development sprints, and wrapper sprints. Pre-game Sprint: The initial phase where the team defines the project vision, outlines features, and establishes the product backlog. Development Sprints: Iterative cycles where the team develops, tests, and refines features from the product backlog. Wrapper Sprints: Final sprints dedicated to polishing and testing the product to ensure all systems function correctly. Scrum Meetings and Artifacts 🔉 This section details the meetings and tools used by Scrum teams to manage their work effectively.\nMeetings: Sprint Planning Meeting: At the beginning of each sprint, the team selects features from the product backlog to include in the current sprint, creating the sprint backlog. 🔉 Daily Scrum: A brief daily meeting where team members discuss their progress, challenges, and plans for the day. Sprint Review: At the end of each sprint, the team reviews its accomplishments, compares them to goals, and updates the product backlog based on feedback. 🔉 Retrospective: A dedicated meeting focused on reviewing the team’s processes and identifying areas for improvement. 🔉 Artifacts: Product Backlog: A prioritized list of all features to be implemented in the project. Sprint Backlog: A subset of the product backlog containing the features selected for the current sprint. Task List: A detailed breakdown of tasks needed to complete each feature in the sprint backlog. Scrum Board: A visual representation of the sprint backlog and task progress, allowing the team to track their work and identify potential bottlenecks. “If you’ve got a team that all works in the same place, it’s usually a physical, big physical board. That you have room to put cards with all the tasks on it on and you just have it divided up into sections to show the status of each task.”\nUser Stories: Building a Product Backlog 🔉 This section explains the importance of user stories in creating a comprehensive and effective product backlog.\nProduct Backlog: More Than Just a Feature List: The product backlog is not just a list of features; it’s a tool for prioritizing and organizing features, ensuring the team focuses on the most critical aspects of the project. “So it is an organized, prioritized feature list. So the team always knows what the most important next feature is.” 🔉\nUser Story Format: User stories are a common format for describing features in the product backlog. They follow a simple structure: “As a [user type], I want to [action], so that [benefit].” “As an unauthorized user, I want to create a new account, so that I can access the application.” 🔉\nEstimating Feature Size: The backlog includes an estimation of the effort required to complete each feature, typically using a simple scale like “small,” “medium,” “large,” or “extra-large.” 🔉 “You can say, what are all the smallest features here and call those small. All the medium features are medium, and all the big features that are really going to take a lot of work, you can call them extra-large.”\nPoints to Ponder How do communication barriers impact team dynamics and productivity? What strategies can be used to address these barriers? 🔉 How does Scrum’s emphasis on transparency, inspection, and adaptability contribute to project success? What are the advantages and disadvantages of having a product owner on a team? Key Takeaways Agile development requires careful consideration of team skills, dependencies, and communication styles. Scrum is an Agile framework that emphasizes transparency, inspection, and adaptability. Scrum teams are responsible for managing their own projects, guided by a Scrum Master and a product owner (if available). 🔉 Sprints provide a structured framework for iterative development and progress tracking. User stories are a valuable tool for creating a comprehensive and prioritized product backlog. Product Backlog\nThis section focuses on defining and creating a product backlog for the game.\nDefining the Backlog: The backlog is a list of features for the game, prioritized by importance. It’s a living document that evolves as the game’s development progresses.\nEstimation: The speaker suggests using rough estimation to get a feel for the overall size of the features. This means grouping similar-sized features and focusing on their relative size rather than precise hours. For example, if a “small” feature takes 3 hours, then other small features are likely to take a similar amount of time.\n“What is bigger than that? That is probably a medium. What is the biggest feature I can see here? Make that a large. When you are making the product backlog, it really is, you do not want to spend a lot of time figuring out estimation and trying to figure out exactly how many hours it is going to take, and how many subtasks are involved.”\nLarge Features: Some features might be massive and need to be broken down into smaller units. The speaker suggests acknowledging these features as “extra-extra-large” and breaking them down later when the team is ready to implement them.\n“It is not a single one feature. It is a whole bunch of different things. So if you come across features that clearly dwarf everything else that you have got is you should try to bring those down into small units and not chunks.” 🔉\nUser Stories: A specific format for describing features in a clear, testable, and understandable manner.\n“A user story is just a very specific way to describe a feature. It is, I think, unique to Scrum, although there may be other agile methodologies that have stolen it as a way of describing a feature.”\nFormat:\nAs the person who will use the feature. 🔉 I want to do something. So that I can achieve this. Example: As a player, I want to be able to move around the game board so that I can explore and interact with the environment. 🔉\nBenefits:\nTestable: Ensures that features are easily validated. User-Focused: Keeps the development process focused on the user experience. Reason Provided: Gives context for the feature and helps to ensure that it meets the needs of the game. Benefits of User Stories\nClear Communication: Helps to ensure that everyone understands the feature’s purpose and how to test it. Reduced Waste: Prevents the team from spending time on unnecessary work. “You are not doing work that does not need to be done that is going to get cut later on. And so a lot of the tools and a lot of the processes and a lot of the language and a lot of meetings are all about making sure that before you go out and put a lot of time into something, it is really the thing that you want to be doing. Okay, and user stories are just one more way to add that check into your process.” 🔉\nTeam Project Presentations\nThe lecture then shifts to a team-based exercise where each group presents their game’s product backlog. Here are some of the games and their core features:\nComcastic: A game where players place internet service stations to build a monopoly. 🔉\nCore Features: Town map Piece placement and rotation Turn mechanics Money tracking Line Dance: A game that aims to be creepy and enthralling. 🔉\nCore Features: Start menu Main screen Character and alien movement Interactions between aliens and characters Shooting Plunderwinds: A turn-based grid-based game with random encounters, exploration, and a wind mechanic. 🔉\nCore Features: Random encounter mechanic Exploration mechanic Wind mechanic Lost 100 Grand: A game where players try to get the most money by placing bombs and moving around the game board.\nCore Features: Game board Bomb placement Moving around the board Revolution: A turn-based game where players progress their beaver quality by making choices each turn. 🔉\nCore Features: Game board Dam building mechanics UI to track resources and beaver quality Magi Dice: A puzzle game where players use modular arithmetic to create zeros and combo chains.\nCore Features: Game board with dice Combo mechanics UI to display points and incentivize combos Sparkly Redemption: A real-time game where players shoot monsters and collect sparklies to gain new weapons and change monster behavior. 🔉\nCore Features: Player character that can move and shoot Monsters with at least two behaviors Sparklies that can be picked up Scrum Meetings\nThe lecture concludes by discussing the different types of Scrum meetings and how they can be used to optimize the development process.\nTime Boxing: A key concept in Scrum, where each meeting or activity is given a specific time limit. This helps to ensure that meetings are productive and efficient.\n“Time boxing is when you decide before you have the meeting or before you start any particular activity how much time you are going to let it take.”\nClear Agenda: It is important to have a clear agenda for each meeting so that everyone knows the purpose of the meeting and what is expected of them.\n“There are three primary tools to do this that we are going to talk about here. We are going to talk about time boxing, having a clear agenda and having involved participants.”\nInvolved Participants: All participants should be actively involved in the meeting. This means that they should be prepared, engaged, and willing to contribute.\nBenefits of Time Boxing 🔉\nFocus: Time boxing helps to keep meetings focused on the most important topics.\nEfficiency: It prevents meetings from dragging on unnecessarily.\nDecision-Making: Encourages the team to make decisions within the allotted time.\n“It does mean that you won’t always reach the perfect solution because after you’ve been talking, if you’ve given yourself an hour to discuss a problem and you’ve talked about it for an hour and you haven’t quite come to a great solution, you stop talking anyway. You decide what the most reasonable solution you’ve talked about is and you go ahead and do that.” 🔉\nThe enemy of perfect is good: By forcing decisions within the time box, the team is less likely to get bogged down in details and can move forward with a workable solution.\n“It’s an implementation of a theory that the perfect is the enemy of the good.” 🔉\nSummary of Key Points\nUser Stories: A valuable tool for defining features and ensuring they are clear, testable, and user-focused. 🔉 Product Backlog: A prioritized list of features for the game that can be used to guide the development process. Scrum Meetings: An essential part of the Scrum process that help to ensure collaboration, communication, and efficiency. Time Boxing: A key principle in Scrum that helps to keep meetings productive and prevent wasted time. [Image_query: A Scrum team working together in a meeting]\nTime Boxing Time boxing is a technique used in Agile software development to allocate a specific amount of time to a task or meeting. It prevents discussions from becoming too lengthy and encourages teams to focus on finding the best solution within the allocated time. “It may be better, and it usually is better, to go ahead with the best solution you came up with and start implementing that and see how it works.”\nEffective Meetings Clear Agenda: Every meeting should have a defined purpose, goal, and desired outcome. “If you don’t know why you are having a meeting, you probably shouldn’t be having it.” 🔉\nFocused Participation: Only those who are directly involved in the meeting should attend. “Not all meetings require the whole team.” 🔉\nActive Engagement: All participants should be present and actively participating in the discussion. 🔉 “Be in the meeting. Don’t be coding in the background. Don’t be checking your cell phone and texting something.” 🔉\nTime Boxing: Meetings should be timeboxed to ensure they stay focused and productive. “Go ahead and be there. Except that you have dedicated the next 15 or 20 minutes to working with your co-workers to solve this particular problem, get the problem solved, get the meeting over, and then get back to your useful things.” 🔉\nScrum Meetings Breakdown Sprint Planning Meeting Goal: To set the team’s goals for the upcoming sprint and create a sprint backlog with estimated tasks. 🔉 Deliverables: A sprint backlog and an estimated task list. Timebox: 1-2 hours (1 hour for smaller teams, 1.5 hours for inexperienced teams). Process: Review the Product Backlog: The team reviews the product backlog created in previous stages to understand the overall project goals. 🔉 Select User Stories: The team selects a subset of user stories from the product backlog that they aim to complete in the sprint. Break Down Stories into Tasks: User stories are broken down into smaller, more manageable tasks. Estimate Task Duration: Each task is assigned an estimated time to complete it. Create Sprint Backlog: The selected user stories and their associated tasks are organized into a sprint backlog, which serves as the roadmap for the sprint. Benefits: Helps the team to focus on the most important tasks. 🔉 Provides a clear roadmap for the sprint. 🔉 Enables the team to track progress and identify potential roadblocks. Sprint Review Meeting Goal: To demonstrate the working product to stakeholders and gather feedback on its progress. Deliverables: A working product and an updated product backlog. Timebox: Approximately 1 hour. Process: Product Demonstration: The team demonstrates the completed features of the product to stakeholders. 🔉 Feedback Gathering: Stakeholders provide feedback on the product’s functionality and features. 🔉 Backlog Updates: The product backlog is updated based on feedback received, adding new features or adjusting priorities. Benefits: Provides an opportunity to showcase the team’s progress and receive valuable feedback. Ensures that the product is aligned with stakeholder expectations. 🔉 Helps to identify any areas that need improvement. 🔉 Sprint Retrospective Meeting Goal: To review the team’s process and identify areas for improvement. Deliverables: A list of action items for improvement. Timebox: Typically 1 hour. Process: Review Sprint Progress: The team discusses what went well during the sprint and what could be improved. Identify Challenges: The team identifies any challenges or roadblocks they encountered. Action Planning: The team develops a list of action items to address the identified challenges. Benefits: Enables continuous improvement by analyzing team processes and identifying areas for refinement. Promotes open and honest communication within the team. 🔉 Fosters a culture of learning and growth. Daily Scrum Meeting Goal: To enhance team accountability, encourage communication, and track progress. Deliverables: Updates on individual progress and any blocking issues. Timebox: 5-15 minutes for smaller teams. Process: Stand-Up Format: Teams often conduct daily scrums standing up to encourage brief updates. Three Questions: Each team member answers the following three questions: 🔉 What did you do yesterday? What are you going to do today? 🔉 What obstacles are you facing? Benefits: Provides a daily snapshot of team progress and identifies any potential roadblocks. Encourages team members to stay informed about each other’s work. Promotes a sense of accountability and helps to keep the team on track. 🔉 Weekend Preparation Schedule a meeting with your team sometime between now and Monday. Ask each team member to be prepared to answer the three daily scrum questions: What did you do yesterday? What are you going to do today? 🔉 What obstacles are you facing? Be Honest: Share any roadblocks or issues you are experiencing to allow your team to help. Choose a Scrum Master: Select one person from your team to act as the Scrum master, responsible for coordinating tasks and communication. Scrum Master Responsibilities Team: Responsible for facilitating Scrum processes and ensuring smooth team collaboration. Instructor: Responsible for uploading project documents (vision documents, product backlogs, design change logs, etc.) and ensuring a link to the completed project. 🔉 Key Takeaways\nMeetings are an essential part of Agile software development, but they should be well-structured and productive. Timeboxing, clear agendas, and focused participation are crucial for effective meetings. Scrum meetings, including sprint planning, sprint review, sprint retrospective, and daily scrums, help to streamline team workflows and promote continuous improvement. The Scrum master plays a vital role in coordinating team activities and ensuring smooth project execution. 🔉 ",

<li><strong>Waterfall model</strong> is a traditional project management approach where each phase is completed before moving to the next. <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --></li>
<li>It involves <strong>sequential stages</strong>:
<ul>
<li><strong>Concepting/Design:</strong> Defining the project scope, features, and constraints.</li>
<li><strong>Pre-Production:</strong> Testing assumptions and validating design choices. <a href="https://youtu.be/UxMpn92vGXs?t=645">🔉</a></li>
<li><strong>Production:</strong> Implementation of the game features.</li>
<li><strong>Alpha:</strong> Initial testing with a small group of testers. <a href="https://youtu.be/UxMpn92vGXs?t=647">🔉</a></li>
<li><strong>Beta:</strong> More extensive testing with a larger group, potentially open to the public. <a href="https://youtu.be/UxMpn92vGXs?t=1535">🔉</a></li>
<li><strong>Shipping:</strong> Release of the final product.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>The major flaw of the waterfall model is the concentration of testing at the end of the project.</strong> <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->  <a href="https://youtu.be/UxMpn92vGXs?t=1887">🔉</a></li>
<li><strong>This late testing can lead to significant design changes and rework, which can strain resources and budgets.</strong></li>
<li><strong>The inability to predict fun and engage users effectively during the early stages is a crucial problem.</strong></li>
<li><strong>In a game, user satisfaction is paramount, and late changes can severely impact its success.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Games are unique because they rely on player engagement and enjoyment, which cannot be fully predicted or designed without user interaction.</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>This section explores the challenges of implementing Agile methods, particularly in teams with diverse skillsets and communication styles.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Communication Barriers:</strong> Teams composed of individuals with different backgrounds and training often experience communication difficulties. This is especially true in game development, where programmers and artists may struggle to understand each other&rsquo;s technical requirements and workflows.
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;The artists will not be able to explain why they can&rsquo;t meet the programmer&rsquo;s technical requirements, and the programmers will be unwilling to figure out why it is the artists can&rsquo;t meet those technical requirements. They&rsquo;ve given the technical requirements. Why don&rsquo;t you just make something that works in it?&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li><strong>Impact on Agile Success:</strong> These communication breakdowns can severely hinder the progress of Agile teams, as effective communication is crucial for problem-solving and collaboration.</li>

<p>This section provides an overview of Scrum, a specific Agile framework, and its core principles.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Scrum Buzzwords:</strong> Transparency, inspection, and adaptability are the guiding principles of Scrum, emphasizing openness, continuous evaluation, and flexibility.
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;You can think of them as scrum&rsquo;s vision statement, but shorter than a document. Essentially, if you are doing scrum right, all of your decisions and processes are transparent.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li><strong>Transparency:</strong> All team members are informed about decisions and processes, ensuring no one feels excluded or uninformed.</li>
<li><strong>Inspection:</strong> The team constantly evaluates its actions, decisions, and deliverables, proactively identifying and addressing potential issues.</li>

<p>This section describes the different roles within a Scrum team and their respective responsibilities.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Team Responsibilities:</strong> In Scrum, the team itself is responsible for project management, guided by its members.  <a href="https://youtu.be/UxMpn92vGXs?t=1378">🔉</a>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;In Scrum, the responsibility for project management doesn&rsquo;t sit with a producer or design lead or the programming lead. It&rsquo;s the team&rsquo;s responsibility guided by the team members to manage their own project.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li><strong>Product Owner:</strong> The product owner is responsible for the overall vision of the product. They create and prioritize the product backlog, ensure features are implemented as intended, and provide feedback to the team.
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;The product owner is the person who holds the sole vision of the product. For classic Scrum teams, the product owner is the person who creates the product backlog, helps them prioritize it, and lets them know which of their features are the most important, and whether or not the features as implemented are working the way they need to.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li><strong>Scrum Master:</strong> The Scrum Master facilitates and mediates team meetings, ensures Scrum practices are followed, and keeps track of project documentation. They act as a coach for the team, promoting collaboration and efficient workflows.
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;The Scrum Master is the lucky person who runs the meetings, serves as the facilitator and the mediator, and is in charge of making sure that Scrum is followed and the team is working reasonably smoothly.&rdquo; <a href="https://youtu.be/UxMpn92vGXs?t=1853">🔉</a></p>

</ul>
<h3 id="span-stylecolorbluescrum-project-cycle-sprintsspan"><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Scrum Project Cycle: Sprints<!-- raw HTML omitted --><a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#span-stylecolorbluescrum-project-cycle-sprintsspan">#</a></h3>
<p>This section describes the overall Scrum project cycle and the role of sprints in dividing the work into manageable chunks.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Sprints:</strong> Sprints are iterative development cycles, typically lasting one to two weeks, during which the team focuses on completing a set of features. <a href="https://youtu.be/UxMpn92vGXs?t=2444">🔉</a>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;A sprint is the way that a Scrum project divides up its design iteration cycles. Sprint length depends on the project and what the team wants.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li><strong>Sprint Cycle:</strong> The Scrum cycle includes pre-game sprint, development sprints, and wrapper sprints.
<ul>
<li><strong>Pre-game Sprint:</strong> The initial phase where the team defines the project vision, outlines features, and establishes the product backlog.</li>
<li><strong>Development Sprints:</strong> Iterative cycles where the team develops, tests, and refines features from the product backlog.</li>
<li><strong>Wrapper Sprints:</strong> Final sprints dedicated to polishing and testing the product to ensure all systems function correctly.</li>
</ul>

<p>This section details the meetings and tools used by Scrum teams to manage their work effectively.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Meetings:</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Sprint Planning Meeting:</strong> At the beginning of each sprint, the team selects features from the product backlog to include in the current sprint, creating the sprint backlog.  <a href="https://youtu.be/UxMpn92vGXs?t=3809">🔉</a></li>
<li><strong>Daily Scrum:</strong> A brief daily meeting where team members discuss their progress, challenges, and plans for the day.</li>
<li><strong>Sprint Review:</strong> At the end of each sprint, the team reviews its accomplishments, compares them to goals, and updates the product backlog based on feedback.  <a href="https://youtu.be/UxMpn92vGXs?t=3876">🔉</a></li>
<li><strong>Retrospective:</strong>  A dedicated meeting focused on reviewing the team&rsquo;s processes and identifying areas for improvement. <a href="https://youtu.be/UxMpn92vGXs?t=3935">🔉</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Artifacts:</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Product Backlog:</strong> A prioritized list of all features to be implemented in the project.</li>
<li><strong>Sprint Backlog:</strong> A subset of the product backlog containing the features selected for the current sprint.</li>
<li><strong>Task List:</strong> A detailed breakdown of tasks needed to complete each feature in the sprint backlog.</li>
<li><strong>Scrum Board:</strong> A visual representation of the sprint backlog and task progress, allowing the team to track their work and identify potential bottlenecks.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;If you&rsquo;ve got a team that all works in the same place, it&rsquo;s usually a physical, big physical board. That you have room to put cards with all the tasks on it on and you just have it divided up into sections to show the status of each task.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This section explains the importance of user stories in creating a comprehensive and effective product backlog.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Product Backlog: More Than Just a Feature List:</strong> The product backlog is not just a list of features; it&rsquo;s a tool for prioritizing and organizing features, ensuring the team focuses on the most critical aspects of the project.
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;So it is an organized, prioritized feature list. So the team always knows what the most important next feature is.&rdquo; <a href="https://youtu.be/UxMpn92vGXs?t=2151">🔉</a></p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li><strong>User Story Format:</strong> User stories are a common format for describing features in the product backlog. They follow a simple structure: &ldquo;As a [user type], I want to [action], so that [benefit].&rdquo;
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;As an unauthorized user, I want to create a new account, so that I can access the application.&rdquo;  <a href="https://youtu.be/UxMpn92vGXs?t=2271">🔉</a></p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li><strong>Estimating Feature Size:</strong>  The backlog includes an estimation of the effort required to complete each feature, typically using a simple scale like &ldquo;small,&rdquo; &ldquo;medium,&rdquo; &ldquo;large,&rdquo; or &ldquo;extra-large.&rdquo; <a href="https://youtu.be/UxMpn92vGXs?t=2295">🔉</a>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;You can say, what are all the smallest features here and call those small. All the medium features are medium, and all the big features that are really going to take a lot of work, you can call them extra-large.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>

</ul>
<h3 id="span-stylecolorbluekey-takeawaysspan-1"><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Key Takeaways<!-- raw HTML omitted --><a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#span-stylecolorbluekey-takeawaysspan-1">#</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>Agile development requires careful consideration of team skills, dependencies, and communication styles.</li>
<li>Scrum is an Agile framework that emphasizes transparency, inspection, and adaptability.</li>
<li>Scrum teams are responsible for managing their own projects, guided by a Scrum Master and a product owner (if available). <a href="https://youtu.be/UxMpn92vGXs?t=1914">🔉</a></li>
<li>Sprints provide a structured framework for iterative development and progress tracking.</li>
<li>User stories are a valuable tool for creating a comprehensive and prioritized product backlog.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Product Backlog</strong></p>
<p>This section focuses on defining and creating a product backlog for the game.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Defining the Backlog:</strong> The backlog is a list of features for the game, prioritized by importance. It&rsquo;s a living document that evolves as the game&rsquo;s development progresses.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Estimation:</strong>  The speaker suggests using rough estimation to get a feel for the overall size of the features. This means grouping similar-sized features and focusing on their relative size rather than precise hours.  For example, if a &ldquo;small&rdquo; feature takes 3 hours, then other small features are likely to take a similar amount of time.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;What is bigger than that? That is probably a medium. What is the biggest feature I can see here? Make that a large. When you are making the product backlog, it really is, you do not want to spend a lot of time figuring out estimation and trying to figure out exactly how many hours it is going to take, and how many subtasks are involved.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Large Features:</strong>  Some features might be massive and need to be broken down into smaller units.  The speaker suggests acknowledging these features as &ldquo;extra-extra-large&rdquo; and breaking them down later when the team is ready to implement them.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;It is not a single one feature. It is a whole bunch of different things. So if you come across features that clearly dwarf everything else that you have got is you should try to bring those down into small units and not chunks.&rdquo; <a href="https://youtu.be/UxMpn92vGXs?t=2400">🔉</a></p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>User Stories:</strong> A specific format for describing features in a clear, testable, and understandable manner.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;A user story is just a very specific way to describe a feature. It is, I think, unique to Scrum, although there may be other agile methodologies that have stolen it as a way of describing a feature.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Format:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>As</strong> the person who will use the feature.  <a href="https://youtu.be/UxMpn92vGXs?t=2584">🔉</a></li>
<li><strong>I want</strong> to do something.</li>
<li><strong>So that</strong> I can achieve this.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Example:</strong> As a player, I want to be able to move around the game board so that I can explore and interact with the environment. <a href="https://youtu.be/UxMpn92vGXs?t=2029">🔉</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Benefits:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Testable:</strong> Ensures that features are easily validated.</li>
<li><strong>User-Focused:</strong> Keeps the development process focused on the user experience.</li>
<li><strong>Reason Provided:</strong>  Gives context for the feature and helps to ensure that it meets the needs of the game.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Benefits of User Stories</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Clear Communication:</strong> Helps to ensure that everyone understands the feature&rsquo;s purpose and how to test it.</li>
<li><strong>Reduced Waste:</strong>  Prevents the team from spending time on unnecessary work.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;You are not doing work that does not need to be done that is going to get cut later on. And so a lot of the tools and a lot of the processes and a lot of the language and a lot of meetings are all about making sure that before you go out and put a lot of time into something, it is really the thing that you want to be doing. Okay, and user stories are just one more way to add that check into your process.&rdquo; <a href="https://youtu.be/UxMpn92vGXs?t=2741">🔉</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Scrum Meetings</strong></p>
<p>The lecture concludes by discussing the different types of Scrum meetings and how they can be used to optimize the development process.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Time Boxing:</strong> A key concept in Scrum, where each meeting or activity is given a specific time limit. This helps to ensure that meetings are productive and efficient.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Time boxing is when you decide before you have the meeting or before you start any particular activity how much time you are going to let it take.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Clear Agenda:</strong>  It is important to have a clear agenda for each meeting so that everyone knows the purpose of the meeting and what is expected of them.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;There are three primary tools to do this that we are going to talk about here. We are going to talk about time boxing, having a clear agenda and having involved participants.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Involved Participants:</strong>  All participants should be actively involved in the meeting. This means that they should be prepared, engaged, and willing to contribute.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Benefits of Time Boxing</strong> <a href="https://youtu.be/UxMpn92vGXs?t=3685">🔉</a></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Focus:</strong> Time boxing helps to keep meetings focused on the most important topics.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Efficiency:</strong> It prevents meetings from dragging on unnecessarily.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Decision-Making:</strong> Encourages the team to make decisions within the allotted time.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;It does mean that you won&rsquo;t always reach the perfect solution because after you&rsquo;ve been talking, if you&rsquo;ve given yourself an hour to discuss a problem and you&rsquo;ve talked about it for an hour and you haven&rsquo;t quite come to a great solution, you stop talking anyway. You decide what the most reasonable solution you&rsquo;ve talked about is and you go ahead and do that.&rdquo; <a href="https://youtu.be/UxMpn92vGXs?t=3642">🔉</a></p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>The enemy of perfect is good:</strong> By forcing decisions within the time box, the team is less likely to get bogged down in details and can move forward with a workable solution.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s an implementation of a theory that the perfect is the enemy of the good.&rdquo; <a href="https://youtu.be/UxMpn92vGXs?t=3658">🔉</a></p>
</blockquote>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Summary of Key Points</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>User Stories:</strong> A valuable tool for defining features and ensuring they are clear, testable, and user-focused. <a href="https://youtu.be/UxMpn92vGXs?t=2511">🔉</a></li>
<li><strong>Product Backlog:</strong>  A prioritized list of features for the game that can be used to guide the development process.</li>
<li><strong>Scrum Meetings:</strong>  An essential part of the Scrum process that help to ensure collaboration, communication, and efficiency.</li>
<li><strong>Time Boxing:</strong> A key principle in Scrum that helps to keep meetings productive and prevent wasted time.</li>
