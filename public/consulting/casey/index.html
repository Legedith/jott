It covers the test format, types of questions, and strategies for success, including a breakdown of the one-minute video recommendation component.\nWhat is the BCG Online Case Study? 🔉 The BCG Online Case Study is a virtual case interview conducted through an interactive chatbot platform. This assessment aims to evaluate candidates’ ability to think like consultants by analyzing business scenarios, formulating solutions, and communicating effectively.\nKey Assessment Criteria:\nBusiness Judgment: Ability to understand and analyze business problems. Logical Thinking: Ability to solve problems logically and systematically. Comfort with Numbers: Proficiency in working with and interpreting data. 🔉 Format and Structure:\nThe assessment is conducted on a platform resembling Facebook Messenger, where you interact with a chatbot named Casey. You have 25 minutes to complete 8-10 questions. 🔉 Questions are categorized into three types: 🔉 Multiple Choice Questions: Choose the correct answer from four options based on provided information. Open-Ended Questions: Explain your reasoning for the chosen multiple-choice answer. 🔉 Redirection or Follow-up Questions: These questions may present additional information or challenge your previous answers. Final Video Recommendation:\nAfter completing the questions, you will be asked to record a one-minute video summarizing your findings and providing a recommendation based on the case scenario. You have one minute to prepare and one minute to record. 🔉 Important Notes:\nNo Backtracking: You cannot revisit previous questions. 🔉 Allowed Resources: Calculators, pens, and paper are permitted during the assessment. 🔉 Time Warnings: Casey will give a five-minute warning before the test ends. 🔉 Preparation Strategies:\nBefore the Test:\nUtilize Free Resources: Explore the BCG Interactive Case Library for case examples and practice. 🔉 Attend Webinars: Participate in BCG Case Interview Prep webinars to gain insights. 🔉 Enhance Business and Test-Taking Skills: 🔉 GMAT Book: Focus on the Quantitative Reasoning and Integrated Reasoning sections for practice. 🔉 Khan Academy Economics: Learn basic economic principles like price elasticity, supply and demand. 🔉 Brush Up on Case Interview Skills: Practice case interview techniques, as these skills will be essential for subsequent interviews. During the Test:\nQuiet Environment: Ensure you are in a quiet space with no distractions. 🔉 Check Equipment: Verify that your internet connection, charger, calculator, and webcam are working properly. Test Webcam and Audio: Ensure your webcam and audio are functioning correctly to facilitate a clear recording for the final video. Live Example 1: Multiple Choice Question 🔉\nQuestion: What is the approximate average gross margin? 🔉\nData: A table with information on gasoline sales, including price per liter, number of liters sold, and cost per liter.\nSolution:\nGross Margin Calculation: Gross Margin = (Gross Profit per Liter) / (Average Price per Liter) 🔉 Gross Profit: Obtain the gross profit per liter from the table. 🔉 Weighted Average Price: Calculate the weighted average price per liter by multiplying each price range by its corresponding sales percentage. Calculate Gross Margin: Divide the gross profit per liter by the weighted average price. Round to one decimal place. Correct Answer: B (6.3%)\nLive Example 2: Multiple Choice Question 🔉\nQuestion: How should we price the gasoline per liter so that the company can maximize profits on gasoline sales? 🔉\nData: A table with data on gasoline prices, number of liters sold, and cost per liter. 🔉\nSolution:\nProfit Formula: Profit = Revenue - Cost Revenue = (Price per Liter) * (Number of Liters Sold) 🔉 Cost = (Cost per Liter) * (Number of Liters Sold) 🔉 Calculate Profit for Each Price Point: Plug the price, cost, and number of liters sold into the profit formula for each price point. Identify Highest Profit: Determine the price point that yields the maximum profit. 🔉 Correct Answer: C (1.7 euros per liter) 🔉\nThe One-Minute Video: Five R’s Framework 🔉\nRecap: Briefly summarize the question being addressed. 🔉 Recommendation: Provide a one-sentence recommendation based on your analysis. 🔉 Reasons: Explain the rationale behind your recommendation. 🔉 Risks: Identify potential risks or drawbacks of your recommendation. 🔉 Retain: Suggest follow-up actions or areas for further investigation. 🔉 Example of a Video Recommendation: 🔉\n“Miss CEO, our team was tasked with determining the optimal price for your gasoline. Based on our analysis, I recommend pricing your gasoline at 1.7 euros per liter. This pricing strategy will maximize profits from gasoline sales. However, a potential risk is that this pricing might deter customers from purchasing other services at your gas station, such as car washes, food, and convenience items. To address this, we could explore the impact of pricing on overall profitability, considering all revenue streams within the gas station.”\nAdditional Resources:\nAccess free consulting training materials and resources by clicking the link provided. Key Takeaways:\nThe BCG Online Case Study assesses business judgment, logical thinking, and comfort with numbers. 🔉 Familiarize yourself with the test format, question types, and practice using free resources. 🔉 Prepare for the one-minute video recommendation by employing the Five R’s framework. 🔉 Utilize available resources and guidance to improve your chances of success.

<p><strong>Example of a Video Recommendation:</strong> <a href="https://youtu.be/j2w_hYLzpi4?t=770">🔉</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Miss CEO, our team was tasked with determining the optimal price for your gasoline. Based on our analysis, I recommend pricing your gasoline at 1.7 euros per liter. This pricing strategy will maximize profits from gasoline sales. However, a potential risk is that this pricing might deter customers from purchasing other services at your gas station, such as car washes, food, and convenience items. To address this, we could explore the impact of pricing on overall profitability, considering all revenue streams within the gas station.&rdquo;</p>
